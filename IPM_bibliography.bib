  abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases threaten wildlife populations and human health. Understanding the spatial distributions of these new diseases is important for disease management and policy makers; however, the data are complicated by heterogeneities across host classes, sampling variance, sampling biases, and the space-time epidemic process. Ignoring these issues can lead to false conclusions or obscure important patterns in the data, such as spatial variation in disease prevalence. Here, we applied hierarchical Bayesian disease mapping methods to account for risk factors and to estimate spatial and temporal patterns of infection by chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) of Wisconsin, USA. We found significant heterogeneities for infection due to age, sex, and spatial location. Infection probability increased with age for all young deer, increased with age faster for young males, and then declined for some older animals, as expected from diseaseassociated mortality and age-related changes in infection risk. We found that disease prevalence was clustered in a central location, as expected under a simple spatial epidemic process where disease prevalence should increase with time and expand spatially. However, we could not detect any consistent temporal or spatiotemporal trends in CWD prevalence. Estimates of the temporal trend indicated that prevalence may have decreased or increased with nearly equal posterior probability, and the model without temporal or spatiotemporal effects was nearly equivalent to models with these effects based on deviance information criteria. For maximum interpretability of the role of location as a disease risk factor, we used the technique of direct standardization for prevalence mapping, which we develop and describe. These mapping results allow disease management actions to be employed with reference to the estimated spatial distribution of the disease and to those host classes most at risk. Future wildlife epidemiology studies should employ hierarchical Bayesian methods to smooth estimated quantities across space and time, account for heterogeneities, and then report disease rates based on an appropriate standardization.},

  title = {The {{Fitting}} of {{General Force}}-of-{{Infection Models}} to {{Wildlife Disease Prevalence Data}}},
  volume = {87},
  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {Researchers and wildlife managers increasingly find themselves in situations where they must deal with infectious wildlife diseases such as chronic wasting disease, brucellosis, tuberculosis, and West Nile virus. Managers are often charged with designing and implementing control strategies, and researchers often seek to determine factors that influence and control the disease process. All of these activities require the ability to measure some indication of a disease's foothold in a population and evaluate factors affecting that foothold. The most common type of data available to managers and researchers is apparent prevalence data. Apparent disease prevalence, the proportion of animals in a sample that are positive for the disease, might seem like a natural measure of disease's foothold, but several properties, in particular, its dependency on age structure and the biasing effects of disease-associated mortality, make it less than ideal. In quantitative epidemiology, the "force of infection," or infection hazard, is generally the preferred parameter for measuring a disease's foothold, and it can be viewed as the most appropriate way to "adjust" apparent prevalence for age structure. The typical ecology curriculum includes little exposure to quantitative epidemiological concepts such as cumulative incidence, apparent prevalence, and the force of infection. The goal of this paper is to present these basic epidemiological concepts and resulting models in an ecological context and to illustrate how they can be applied to understand and address basic epidemiological questions. We demonstrate a practical approach to solving the heretofore intractable problem of fitting general force-of-infection models to wildlife prevalence data using a generalized regression approach. We apply the procedures to Mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis) prevalence in bison (Bison bison) in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, and demonstrate strong age dependency in the force of infection as well as an increased mortality hazard in positive animals.},

CWD epidemics are occurring in free-ranging cervids at several locations in North America, and other wildlife species are certainly being exposed to infectious material. To assess the potential for transmission, we intracerebrally inoculated four species of epidemic-sympatric rodents with CWD. Transmission was efficient in all species; the onset of disease was faster in the two vole species than the two Peromyscus spp. The results for inocula prepared from CWD-positive deer with or without CWD-resistant genotypes were similar. Survival times were substantially shortened upon second passage, demonstrating adaptation. Unlike all other known prion protein sequences for cricetid rodents that possess asparagine at position 170, our red-backed voles expressed serine and refute previous suggestions that a serine in this position substantially reduces susceptibility to CWD. Given the scavenging habits of these rodent species, the apparent persistence of CWD prions in the environment, and the inevitable exposure of these rodents to CWD prions, our intracerebral challenge results indicate that further investigation of the possibility of natural transmission is warranted.},

  shorttitle = {Wildlife Contact Analysis},
  abstract = {Recent technological advances, such as proximity loggers, allow researchers to collect complete interaction histories, day and night, among sampled individuals over several months to years. Social network analyses are an obvious approach to analyzing interaction data because of their flexibility for fitting many different social structures as well as the ability to assess both direct contacts and indirect associations via intermediaries. For many network properties, however, it is not clear whether estimates based upon a sample of the network are reflective of the entire network. In wildlife applications, networks may be poorly sampled and boundary effects will be common. We present an alternative approach that utilizes a hierarchical modeling framework to assess the individual, dyadic, and environmental factors contributing to variation in the interaction rates and allows us to estimate the underlying process variation in each. In a disease control context, this approach will allow managers to focus efforts on those types of individuals and environments that contribute the most toward super-spreading events. We account for the sampling distribution of proximity loggers and the non-independence of contacts among groups by only using contact data within a group during days when the group membership of proximity loggers was known. This allows us to separate the two mechanisms responsible for a pair not contacting one another: they were not in the same group or they were in the same group but did not come within the specified contact distance. We illustrate our approach with an example dataset of female elk from northwestern Wyoming and conclude with a number of important future research directions.},

  abstract = {The genetic basis of susceptibility to chronic wasting disease (CWD) in free-ranging cervids is of great interest. Association studies of disease susceptibility in free-ranging populations, however, face considerable challenges including: the need for large sample sizes when disease is rare, animals of unknown pedigree create a risk of spurious results due to population admixture, and the inability to control disease exposure or dose. We used an innovative matched case\textendash{}control design and conditional logistic regression to evaluate associations between polymorphisms of complement C1q and prion protein (Prnp) genes and CWD infection in white-tailed deer from the CWD endemic area in south-central Wisconsin. To reduce problems due to admixture or disease-risk confounding, we used neutral genetic (microsatellite) data to identify closely related CWD-positive (n=68) and CWD-negative (n=91) female deer to serve as matched cases and controls. Cases and controls were also matched on factors (sex, location, age) previously demonstrated to affect CWD infection risk. For Prnp, deer with at least one Serine (S) at amino acid 96 were significantly less likely to be CWD-positive relative to deer homozygous for Glycine (G). This is the first characterization of genes associated with the complement system in white-tailed deer. No tests for association between any C1q polymorphism and CWD infection were significant at p$<$0.05. After controlling for Prnp, we found weak support for an elevated risk of CWD infection in deer with at least one Glycine (G) at amino acid 56 of the C1qC gene. While we documented numerous amino acid polymorphisms in C1q genes none appear to be strongly associated with CWD susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Understanding the seasonal timing of disease transmission can lead to more effective control strategies, but the seasonality of transmission is often unknown for pathogens transmitted directly. We inserted vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) in 575 elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis) from 2006 to 2014 to assess when reproductive failures (i.e., abortions or still births) occur, which is the primary transmission route of Brucella abortus, the causative agent of brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Using a survival analysis framework, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that simultaneously estimated the total baseline hazard of a reproductive event as well as its 2 mutually exclusive parts (abortions or live births). Approximately, 16\% (95\% CI\,=\,0.10, 0.23) of the pregnant seropositive elk had reproductive failures, whereas 2\% (95\% CI\,=\,0.01, 0.04) of the seronegative elk had probable abortions. Reproductive failures could have occurred as early as 13 February and as late as 10 July, peaking from March through May. Model results suggest that less than 5\% of likely abortions occurred after 6 June each year and abortions were approximately 5 times more likely in March, April, or May compared to February or June. In western Wyoming, supplemental feeding of elk begins in December and ends during the peak of elk abortions and brucellosis transmission (i.e., Mar and Apr). Years with more snow may enhance elk-to-elk transmission on supplemental feeding areas because elk are artificially aggregated for the majority of the transmission season. Elk-to-cattle transmission will depend on the transmission period relative to the end of the supplemental feeding season, elk seroprevalence, population size, and the amount of commingling. Our statistical approach allowed us to estimate the probability density function of different event types over time, which may be applicable to other cause-specific survival analyses. It is often challenging to assess the cause of death, or in this case whether the reproductive event was an abortion or live birth. Accounting for uncertainty in the event type is an important future addition to our methodological approach. Published 2015.

  abstract = {Many ecological and epidemiological studies occur in systems with mobile individuals and heterogeneous landscapes. Using a simulation model, we show that the accuracy of inferring an underlying biological process from observational data depends on movement and spatial scale of the analysis. As an example, we focused on estimating the relationship between host density and pathogen transmission. Observational data can result in highly biased inference about the underlying process when individuals move among sampling areas. Even without sampling error, the effect of host density on disease transmission is underestimated by approximately 50 \% when one in ten hosts move among sampling areas per lifetime. Aggregating data across larger regions causes minimal bias when host movement is low, and results in less biased inference when movement rates are high. However, increasing data aggregation reduces the observed spatial variation, which would lead to the misperception that a spatially targeted control effort may not be very effective. In addition, averaging over the local heterogeneity will result in underestimating the importance of spatial covariates. Minimizing the bias due to movement is not just about choosing the best spatial scale for analysis, but also about reducing the error associated with using the sampling location as a proxy for an individual's spatial history. This error associated with the exposure covariate can be reduced by choosing sampling regions with less movement, including longitudinal information of individuals' movements, or reducing the window of exposure by using repeated sampling or younger individuals.},

We then compared county-level efficiency indices with corresponding amounts and spatial characteristics of forest patches derived from classified satellite imagery. We also compared harvest efficiency with relative human occupation of the landscape based on census data. Deer were more susceptible to harvest in counties with small amounts of highly fragmented forest cover than in more heavily and contiguously forested areas. Harvest efficiency also was slightly higher in sparsely populated counties than in those with greater human presence.

  abstract = {Statistical population reconstruction (SPR) using hunter-supplied, age-at-harvest data provides a flexible framework for estimating population parameters and trends over large geographic areas. Early development of the technique assumed natural survival and the vulnerability coefficients that translate hunter effort into harvest mortality are constant over time. We developed random-effects models that relaxed these assumptions to produce more realistic models for cohort analysis. We compared the statistical performance of fixed-effects and random-effects models and the relative benefits of single-stage and 2-stage estimators of abundance with Monte Carlo simulation studies. In single-stage analyses, initial cohort abundance is estimated directly within the likelihood model. In 2-stage analyses, survival and harvest probabilities are estimated using likelihood conditional on total cohort harvest. Annual abundances are then estimated outside the likelihood using Horvitz\&\#x2014;Thompson type estimators. Our simulation results indicate random-effects models conditional on total cohort harvest have low bias and yield asymptotic 95\% confidence intervals that have near nominal coverage. The other estimation procedures produced confidence intervals for annual abundance that had far-from-nominal coverage. Our new random-effects, 2-stage model is illustrated using 18 years of age-at-harvest data from an elk (Cervus elaphus) herd in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Results indicate the multistage estimation process incorporating random effects provides accurate abundance estimates and confidence interval coverage, and we recommend its use.},

  abstract = {N-mixture models describe count data replicated in time and across sites in terms of abundance N and detectability p. They are popular because they allow inference about N while controlling for factors that influence p without the need for marking animals. Using a capture\textendash{}recapture perspective, we show that the loss of information that results from not marking animals is critical, making reliable statistical modeling of N and p problematic using just count data. One cannot reliably fit a model in which the detection probabilities are distinct among repeat visits as this model is overspecified. This makes uncontrolled variation in p problematic. By counter example, we show that even if p is constant after adjusting for covariate effects (the ``constant p'' assumption) scientifically plausible alternative models in which N (or its expectation) is non-identifiable or does not even exist as a parameter, lead to data that are practically indistinguishable from data generated under an N-mixture model. This is particularly the case for sparse data as is commonly seen in applications. We conclude that under the constant p assumption reliable inference is only possible for relative abundance in the absence of questionable and/or untestable assumptions or with better quality data than seen in typical applications. Relative abundance models for counts can be readily fitted using Poisson regression in standard software such as R and are sufficiently flexible to allow controlling for p through the use covariates while simultaneously modeling variation in relative abundance. If users require estimates of absolute abundance, they should collect auxiliary data that help with estimation of p.},

Simulation results showed that intrinsically identifiable parameters were estimated without bias and that precision of survival estimates was always high. When temporary emigration was Markovian, precision of estimates of emigration, immigration, and recapture probabilities was acceptable; otherwise it was not. Test component 2.Ct of the goodness-of-fit test for the CJS model had good power to detect Markovian temporary emigration.

This trend has been driven by the perception of an increase in emerging zoonotic diseases and the recognition that wildlife can be a critical factor for controlling infectious diseases in domestic animals. Cervids are of recent concern because, as a group, they present a number of unique challenges. Their close ecological and phylogenetic relationship to livestock species places them at risk for receiving infections from, and reinfecting livestock. In addition, cervids are an important resource; revenue from hunting and viewing contribute substantially to agency budgets and local economies. A comprehensive coverage of infectious diseases in cervids is well beyond the scope of this chapter. In North America alone there are a number of infectious diseases that can potentially impact cervid populations, but for most of these, management is not feasible or the diseases are only a potential or future concern. We focus this chapter on three diseases that are of major management concern and the center of most disease research for cervids in North America: bovine tuberculosis, chronic wasting disease, and brucellosis. We discuss the available data and recent advances in modeling and management of these diseases.},

Nonetheless, studies measuring population-level effects of pathogens in wild host populations are rare, and taxonomically biased toward avian hosts and macroparasitic infections.

We tested 1180 buffalo for bTB infection between May 2000 and November 2001. Most infections were mild, confirming the chronic nature of the disease in buffalo. However, our data indicate that bTB affects both adult survival and fecundity. Using an age-structured population model, we demonstrate that the pathogen can reduce population growth rate drastically; yet its effects appear difficult to detect at the population level: bTB causes no conspicuous mass mortalities or fast population declines, nor does it alter host-population age structure significantly. Our models suggest that this syndrome\textemdash{}low detectability coupled with severe impacts on population growth rate and, therefore, resilience\textemdash{}may be characteristic of chronic diseases in large mammals.},

  abstract = {Prions are unprecedented infectious pathogens that cause a group of invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases by an entirely novel mechanism. Prion diseases may present as genetic, infectious, or sporadic disorders, all of which involve modification of the prion protein (PrP). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie of sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans are among the most notable prion diseases. Prions are transmissible particles that are devoid of nucleic acid and seem to be composed exclusively of a modified protein (PrPSc). The normal, cellular PrP (PrPC) is converted into PrPSc through a posttranslational process during which it acquires a high \&\#x3b2; -sheet content. The species of a particular prion is encoded by the sequence of the chromosomal PrP gene of the mammals in which it last replicated. In contrast to pathogens carrying a nucleic acid genome, prions appear to encipher strain-specific properties in the tertiary structure of PrPSc. Transgenetic studies argue that PrPSc acts as a template upon which PrPC is refolded into a nascent PrPSc molecule through a process facilitated by another protein. Miniprions generated in transgenic mice expressing PrP, in which nearly half of the residues were deleted, exhibit unique biological properties and should facilitate structural studies of PrPSc. While knowledge about prions has profound implications for studies of the structural plasticity of proteins, investigations of prion diseases suggest that new strategies for the prevention and treatment of these disorders may also find application in the more common degenerative diseases.},

Many of the policies and programmes intended to prevent extinctions operate on the assumption that the factors driving the decline of a population can be determined. Exogenous factors that cause declines in abundance can be statistically confounded with endogenous factors such as density dependence. To demonstrate the potential for confounding, we used an experiment where replicated populations were driven to extinction by gradually manipulating habitat quality. In many of the replicated populations, habitat quality and density dependence were confounded, which obscured causal inference. Our results show that confounding is likely to occur when the exogenous factors that are driving the decline change gradually over time. Our study has direct implications for wild populations, because many factors that could drive a population to extinction change gradually through time.},

  abstract = {Many host-parasite models assume that transmission increases linearly with host population density (`density-dependent transmission'), but various alternative transmission functions have been proposed in an effort to capture the complexity of real biological systems. The most common alternative (usually applied to sexually transmitted parasites) assumes instead that the rate at which hosts contact one another is independent of population density, leading to `frequency-dependent' transmission. This straight-forward distinction generates fundamentally different dynamics (e.g. deterministic, parasite-driven extinction with frequency- but not density-dependence). Here, we consider the situation where transmission occurs through two different types of contact, one of which is density-dependent (e.g. social contacts), the other density-independent (e.g. sexual contacts). Drawing on a range of biological examples, we propose that this type of contact structure may be widespread in natural populations. When our model is characterized mainly by density-dependent transmission, we find that allowing even small amounts of transmission to occur through density-independent contacts leads to the possibility of deterministic, parasite-driven extinction (and lowers the threshold for parasite persistence). Contrastingly, allowing some density-dependent transmission to occur in a model characterized mainly by density-independent contacts (i.e. by frequency-dependent transmission) does not affect the extinction threshold, but does increase the likelihood of parasite persistence. The idea that directly transmitted parasites exploit different types of host contact is not new, but here we show that the impact on dynamics can be fundamental even in the simplest cases. For example, in systems where density-dependent transmission is normally assumed de facto, we show that parasite-driven extinction can occur if a small amount of transmission occurs through density-independent contacts. Many empirical studies are still guided by the traditional density/frequency dichotomy, but our combined transmission function may provide a better model for systems in which both types of transmission occur.},

  abstract = {We analyzed counts of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, over 70 years to evaluate the effects of changing management on population trends. Population reduction efforts and hunter harvests during 1932-1968 removed 71,330 elk and decreased estimated abundance from 16,000 to 6,000 elk. Abundance increased to approximately 17,000 elk (\&\#x3b1; = 1.19) when removals ceased and harvests were very small during 1969-1975. Moderate to liberal hunter harvests of antlerless elk outside the Park during 1976-2004 removed a relatively consistent proportion (26 \&\#xb1; 0.1 [SD]\%) of females that migrated outside the park, mostly from primeage (3-15 yr) classes with high reproductive value. Substantial winterkill was infrequent (1989, 1997), but it significantly reduced calf survival when it occurred. Wolves (Canis lupus) were reintroduced in 1995-1996 and rapidly increased in abundance (\&\#x3b1; = 1.23) and distribution. Estimated wolf kill of elk now exceeds hunter harvest, but has a smaller effect on population dynamics because wolves concentrate on calves and older females ($\backslash$textgreater14 yr) with low reproductive value. During 1995-2004, estimated abundance decreased from 23,000 to 12,000 elk. The recent ratio of wolves to elk is relatively low compared to the estimated equilibrium ratio, suggesting that the wolf population may yet increase in the future. Thus, reduction of harvests of prime-aged female elk to decrease removals of animals with high reproductive value and increase adult female survival appears essential. We analyzed the relative impact of removals by hunters and by wolves using Fisher's (1930) reproductive value and found that the impact of hunters is far more important than that by wolves, a finding of broad significance.},

  abstract = {In the United States and several other countries, the development of population viability analyses (PVA) is a legal requirement of any species survival plan developed for threatened and endangered species. Despite the importance of pathogens in natural populations, little attention has been given to host\textendash{}pathogen dynamics in PVA. To study the effect of infectious pathogens on extinction risk estimates generated from PVA, we review and synthesize the relevance of host\textendash{}pathogen dynamics in analyses of extinction risk. We then develop a stochastic, density-dependent host\textendash{}parasite model to investigate the effects of disease on the persistence of endangered populations. We show that this model converges on a Ricker model of density dependence under a suite of limiting assumptions, including a high probability that epidemics will arrive and occur. Using this modeling framework, we then quantify: (1) dynamic differences between time series generated by disease and Ricker processes with the same parameters; (2) observed probabilities of quasi-extinction for populations exposed to disease or self-limitation; and (3) bias in probabilities of quasi-extinction estimated by density-independent PVAs when populations experience either form of density dependence. Our results suggest two generalities about the relationships among disease, PVA, and the management of endangered species. First, disease more strongly increases variability in host abundance and, thus, the probability of quasi-extinction, than does self-limitation. This result stems from the fact that the effects and the probability of occurrence of disease are both density dependent. Second, estimates of quasi-extinction are more often overly optimistic for populations experiencing disease than for those subject to self-limitation. Thus, although the results of density-independent PVAs may be relatively robust to some particular assumptions about density dependence, they are less robust when endangered populations are known to be susceptible to disease. If potential management actions involve manipulating pathogens, then it may be useful to model disease explicitly.},

  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal disease of deer, elk, and moose transmitted through direct, animal-to-animal contact, and indirectly, via environmental contamination. Considerable attention has been paid to modeling direct transmission, but despite the fact that CWD prions can remain infectious in the environment for years, relatively little information exists about the potential effects of indirect transmission on CWD dynamics. In the present study, we use simulation models to demonstrate how indirect transmission and the duration of environmental prion persistence may affect epidemics of CWD and populations of North American deer. Existing data from Colorado, Wyoming, and Wisconsin's CWD epidemics were used to define plausible short-term outcomes and associated parameter spaces. Resulting long-term outcomes range from relatively low disease prevalence and limited host-population decline to host-population collapse and extinction. Our models suggest that disease prevalence and the severity of population decline is driven by the duration that prions remain infectious in the environment. Despite relatively low epidemic growth rates, the basic reproductive number, R0, may be much larger than expected under the direct-transmission paradigm because the infectious period can vastly exceed the host's life span. High prion persistence is expected to lead to an increasing environmental pool of prions during the early phases (i.e. approximately during the first 50 years) of the epidemic. As a consequence, over this period of time, disease dynamics will become more heavily influenced by indirect transmission, which may explain some of the observed regional differences in age and sex-specific disease patterns. This suggests management interventions, such as culling or vaccination, will become increasingly less effective as CWD epidemics progress.},

  abstract = {Emerging wildlife diseases pose a significant threat to natural and human systems. Because of real or perceived risks of delayed actions, disease management strategies such as culling are often implemented before thorough scientific knowledge of disease dynamics is available. Adaptive management is a valuable approach in addressing the uncertainty and complexity associated with wildlife disease problems and can be facilitated by using a formal model.2We developed a multi-state computer simulation model using age, sex, infection-stage, and seasonality as a tool for scientific learning and managing chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. Our matrix model used disease transmission parameters based on data collected through disease management activities. We used this model to evaluate management issues on density- (DD) and frequency-dependent (FD) transmission, time since disease introduction, and deer culling on the demographics, epizootiology, and management of CWD.3Both DD and FD models fit the Wisconsin data for a harvested white-tailed deer population, but FD was slightly better. Time since disease introduction was estimated as 36 (95\% CI, 24\textendash{}50) and 188 (41\textendash$\backslash$textgreater200) years for DD and FD transmission, respectively. Deer harvest using intermediate to high non-selective rates can be used to reduce uncertainty between DD and FD transmission and improve our prediction of long-term epidemic patterns and host population impacts. A higher harvest rate allows earlier detection of these differences, but substantially reduces deer abundance.4Results showed that CWD has spread slowly within Wisconsin deer populations, and therefore, epidemics and disease management are expected to last for decades. Non-hunted deer populations can develop and sustain a high level of infection, generating a substantial risk of disease spread. In contrast, CWD prevalence remains lower in hunted deer populations, but at a higher prevalence the disease competes with recreational hunting to reduce deer abundance.5Synthesis and applications. Uncertainty about density- or frequency-dependent transmission hinders predictions about the long-term impacts of chronic wasting disease on cervid populations and the development of appropriate management strategies. An adaptive management strategy using computer modelling coupled with experimental management and monitoring can be used to test model predictions, identify the likely mode of disease transmission, and evaluate the risks of alternative management responses.},

  abstract = {We developed a mechanistic model to simulate dynamics of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations. The model projected age-specific disease dynamics, changes in population size, and effects of control strategies. We estimated parameters from observations of infected and uninfected mule deer in Colorado. We used Monte Carlo techniques to evaluate likely responses. Simulations of CWD epidemics were highly unstable. Disease was not sustained in projected populations when transmission rates were low, but CWD eliminated populations when more realistic transmission rates were used. We failed to produce stable coexistence of CWD in simulated mule deer populations. Even low CWD prevalence reduced potential harvest via combined effects of diminished per-capita production and decreased population density. Changes in CWD prevalence within populations were highly sensitive to transmission rate, and small decreases resulted in noticeable damping of prevalence increases. Simulated selective culling programs revealed the importance of initiating control while CWD prevalence was low ($\backslash$textless0.01). Low selective culling rates ($\backslash$textless20\% of infected populations) effectively eliminated CWD if initiated when prevalence was low, but the likelihood of control diminished rapidly as prevalence increased. Management programs will likely require an effort sustained over many decades if eliminating CWD is the desired goal.},

  abstract = {Abstract Strategies to contain the spread of disease often are developed with incomplete knowledge of the possible outcomes but are intended to minimize the risks associated with delaying control. Culling of game species by government agencies is one approach to control disease in wild populations but is unpopular with hunters and wildlife enthusiasts, politically unpalatable, and erodes public support for agencies responsible for wildlife management. We addressed the functional differences between hunting and government culling programs for managing chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer by comparing prevalence over a 10-year period in Illinois and Wisconsin. When both Illinois and Wisconsin were actively culling from 2003 \textendash{} 2007, there were no statistical differences between state CWD prevalence estimates. Wisconsin government culling concluded in 2007 and average prevalence over the next five years was 3.09 $\pm$ 1.13\% with an average annual increase of 0.63\%. During that same time period, Illinois continued government culling and there was no change in prevalence throughout Illinois. Despite its unpopularity among hunters, localized culling is a disease management strategy that can maintain low disease prevalence while minimizing impacts on recreational deer harvest.},

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {Few studies have evaluated the rate of infection or mode of transmission for wildlife diseases, and the implications of alternative management strategies. We used hunter harvest data from 2002 to 2013 to investigate chronic wasting disease (CWD) infection rate and transmission modes, and address how alternative management approaches affect disease dynamics in a Wisconsin white-tailed deer population. Uncertainty regarding demographic impacts of CWD on cervid populations, human and domestic animal health concerns, and potential economic consequences underscore the need for strategies to control CWD distribution and prevalence. Using maximum-likelihood methods to evaluate alternative multi-state deterministic models of CWD transmission, harvest data strongly supports a frequency-dependent transmission structure with sex-specific infection rates that are two times higher in males than females. As transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are an important and difficult-to-study class of diseases with major economic and ecological implications, our work supports the hypothesis of frequency-dependent transmission in wild deer at a broad spatial scale and indicates that effective harvest management can be implemented to control CWD prevalence. Specifically, we show that harvest focused on the greater-affected sex (males) can result in stable population dynamics and control of CWD within the next 50 years, given the constraints of the model. We also provide a quantitative estimate of geographic disease spread in southern Wisconsin, validating qualitative assessments that CWD spreads relatively slowly. Given increased discovery and distribution of CWD throughout North America, insights from our study are valuable to management agencies and to the general public concerned about the impacts of CWD on white-tailed deer populations.},

We present an approach for using wildlife disease surveillance data to identify areas for (or of ) intervention, to spatially delineate paired treatment and control areas, and then to analyze these nonrandomly selected sites in a meta-analysis framework via before\textendash{}after\textendash{}control\textendash{}impact (BACI) estimates of effect size. We apply these methods to evaluate the effectiveness of attempts to reduce chronic wasting disease (CWD) prevalence through intensive localized culling of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in north-central Colorado, USA. Areas where surveillance data revealed high prevalence or case clusters were targeted by state wildlife management agency personnel for focal scale (on average $\backslash$textless17 km2) culling, primarily via agency sharpshooters. Each area of sustained culling that we could also identify as unique by cluster analysis was considered a potential treatment area. Treatment areas, along with spatially paired control areas that we constructed post hoc in a case-control design (collectively called ``management evaluation sites''), were then delineated using home range estimators. Using meta-BACI analysis of CWD prevalence data for all management evaluation sites, the mean effect size (change of prevalence on treatment areas minus change in prevalence on their paired control areas) was 0.03 (SE = 0.03); mean effect size on treatment areas was not greater than on paired control areas. Excluding cull samples from prevalence estimates or allowing for an equal or greater two-year lag in system responses to management did not change this outcome. We concluded that management benefits were not evident, although whether this represented true ineffectiveness or was a result of lack of data or insufficient duration of treatment could not be discerned. Based on our observations, we offer recommendations for designing a management experiment with 80\% power to detect a 0.10 drop in prevalence over a 6\textendash{}12-year period.},

  abstract = {Transmission is the driving force in the dynamics of any infectious disease. A crucial element in understanding disease dynamics, therefore, is the 'transmission term' describing the rate at which susceptible hosts are 'converted' into infected hosts by their contact with infectious material. Recently, the conventional form of this term has been increasingly questioned, and new terminologies and conventions have been proposed. Here, therefore, we review the derivation of transmission terms, explain the basis of confusion, and provide clarification. The root of the problem has been a failure to include explicit consideration of the area occupied by a host population, alongside both the number of infectious hosts and their density within the population. We argue that the terms 'density-dependent transmission' and 'frequency-dependent transmission' remain valid and useful (though a 'fuller' transmission term for the former is identified), but that the terms 'mass action', 'true mass action' and 'pseudo mass action' are all unhelpful and should be dropped. Also, contrary to what has often been assumed, the distinction between homogenous and heterogeneous mixing in a host population is orthogonal to the distinction between density- and frequency-dependent transmission modes.},

Here, we used ecological and genetic information to delineate management units for a complex system involving several ecotypes of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) from Qu\{\'e\}bec and Labrador, eastern Canada. We genotyped 560 caribou at 16 microsatellite loci and used three Bayesian clustering methods to spatially delineate and characterize genetic structure across the landscape. The different approaches employed did not converge on the same solution, and differed in the number of inferred genetic clusters that best fit the dataset but also in the spatial distribution of genetic variation. We reconciled variability among the methods using a synthetic approach that considers the sum of the partitions obtained by each of them and retrieved six genetically distinct groups that differ in their spatial extent across the range of caribou in the study area. These genetic groups are not consistent with the presently defined ecological designations for this species. Combining both genetic and ecological criteria, we distinguished eight independent management units. Overall, the management units we propose should be the focus of conservation and management actions aimed to maximize genetic and ecological diversity and ensure the persistence of caribou populations inhabiting increasingly disturbed landscapes.},

  abstract = {Models of the dynamics of large herbivore populations represent density feedbacks on the population growth rate either directly or indirectly through interactions with vegetation resources. Neither approach incorporates the spatial heterogeneity that is an essential feature of most natural environments, and modifies the population dynamics generated. This is especially true for large herbivores exploiting food resources that are rooted in space but temporally variable in quantity and quality both seasonally and annually. In this review I explore how environmental variation at different spatiotemporal scales influences the abundance of herbivore populations controlled via resources, predators or social mechanisms. Changes in abundance can be spatially disparate and dependent on different resource components at different stages of the seasonal cycle, including buffer resources restricting population crashes in extremely adverse years. GPS telemetry enables movement responses generating spatial patterns to be documented in fine spatiotemporal detail, including migration and dispersal. Models incorporating spatial heterogeneity either implicitly or explicitly are outlined, exemplifying how herbivores cope with temporal variability by exploiting spatial variability in resources and conditions. Global human dominance is generating widened climatic variation while opportunities for herbivore movements are becoming constricted. Theoretical population ecologists need to shift their focus from the workings of demographic structure towards effects of changing environmental contexts, in order to project the likely trajectories of large herbivore populations through the Anthropocene.},

The prevalence of these PEs in aquatic organisms is as yet unknown, and can be difficult to quantify; however, understanding mechanisms that stabilize populations in the face of environmental change is a key concern in ecology. Here, we examine PEs in Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) in Puget Sound (USA) using a 40-year time series of biomass data for 19 distinct spawning population units collected using two survey types. Multivariate auto-regressive state-space models show independent dynamics among spawning subpopulations, suggesting that variation in herring production is partially driven by local effects at spawning grounds or during the earliest life history stages. This independence at the subpopulation level confers a stabilizing effect on the overall Puget Sound spawning stock, with herring being as much as three times more stable in the face of environmental perturbation than a single population unit of the same size. Herring populations within Puget Sound are highly asynchronous but share a common negative growth rate and may be influenced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The biocomplexity in the herring stock shown here demonstrates that preserving spatial and demographic diversity can increase the stability of this herring population and its availability as a resource for consumers.},

  abstract = {Environmental conditions experienced during early growth and development markedly shape phenotypic traits. Consequently, individuals of the same cohort may show similar life-history tactics throughout life. Conditions experienced later in life, however, could fine-tune these initial differences, either increasing (cumulative effect) or decreasing (compensatory effect) the magnitude of cohort variation with increasing age. Our novel comparative analysis that quantifies cohort variation in individual body size trajectories shows that initial cohort variation dissipates throughout life, and that lifetime patterns change both across species with different paces of life and between sexes. We used longitudinal data on body size (mostly assessed using mass) from 11 populations of large herbivores spread along the ``slow-fast'' continuum of life histories. We first quantified cohort variation using mixture models to identify clusters of cohorts with similar initial size. We identified clear cohort clusters in all species except the one with the slowest pace of life, revealing that variation in early size is structured among cohorts and highlighting typological differences among cohorts. Growth trajectories differed among cohort clusters, highlighting how early size is a fundamental determinant of lifetime growth patterns. In all species, among-cohort variation in size peaked at the start of life, then quickly decreased with age and stabilized around mid-life. Cohort variation was lower in species with a slower than a faster pace of life, and vanished at prime age in species with the slowest pace of life. After accounting for viability selection, compensatory/catch-up growth in early life explained much of the decrease in cohort variation. Females showed less phenotypic variability and stronger compensatory/catch-up growth than males early in life, whereas males showed more progressive changes throughout life. These results confirm that stronger selective pressures for rapid growth make males more vulnerable to poor environmental conditions early in life and less able to recover after a poor start. Our comparative analysis illustrates how variability in growth changes over time in closely related species that span a wide range on the slow-fast continuum, the main axis of variation in life-history strategies of vertebrates.},

We constructed a 5-stage Lefkovitch matrix model for each population. The models showed that the southern population was stable and slightly increasing (\&\#x3bb; = 1.02), whereas the northern population was in decline (\&\#x3bb; = 0.870). We integrated potential impacts of climate change into the northern population model to determine how the population might respond to increased temperature and decreased precipitation. An increase in temperature would benefit the northern population; however, a decrease in precipitation or the combined effects of temperature increase and precipitation decrease would negatively affect the viability of the northern population. Two priorities result from modeling these scenarios: 1) a long-term monitoring program is needed to acquire the life-history and vital rate data on the northern population, and 2) current alligator habitat must be conserved or improved to insulate the species from potential drought associated with climate change.},

  volume = {3},
  abstract = {Body size and age at maturity are indicative of the vulnerability of a species to extinction. However, they are both difficult to estimate for large animals that cannot be restrained for measurement. For very large species such as whale sharks, body size is commonly estimated visually, potentially resulting in the addition of errors and bias. Here, we investigate the errors and bias associated with total lengths of whale sharks estimated visually by comparing them with measurements collected using a stereo-video camera system at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Using linear mixed-effects models, we found that visual lengths were biased towards underestimation with increasing size of the shark. When using the stereo-video camera, the number of larger individuals that were possibly mature (or close to maturity) that were detected increased by approximately 10\%. Mean lengths calculated by each method were, however, comparable (5.002 $\pm$ 1.194 and 6.128 $\pm$ 1.609 m, s.d.), confirming that the population at Ningaloo is mostly composed of immature sharks based on published lengths at maturity. We then collated data sets of total lengths sampled from aggregations of whale sharks worldwide between 1995 and 2013. Except for locations in the East Pacific where large females have been reported, these aggregations also largely consisted of juveniles (mean lengths less than 7 m). Sightings of the largest individuals were limited and occurred mostly prior to 2006. This result highlights the urgent need to locate and quantify the numbers of mature male and female whale sharks in order to ascertain the conservation status and ensure persistence of the species.},

Photo-identification (photo-ID) of free-ranging individuals is a cost-effective alternative to conventional tagging for mark-recapture studies that also minimises the risk of injury or stress to the animals. Paired laser-photogrammetry (photogrammetry) is a minimally invasive technique to size animals and has been proven effective in a range of different taxa. Photo-ID and photogrammetry were combined as minimally invasive techniques to determine life-history parameters of free-ranging green sea turtles Chelonia mydas at a site in Oslob, Cebu, Philippines. The pattern-recognition software \{I3S\} Pattern was used to validate results and confirm visual matching. A total of 38 individuals were identified at the site through photo-ID. Facial scutes remained unchanged for a min. of 3.6 years. Photogrammetry was employed to measure straight carapace lengths (SCLs) of a sample of 17 individuals, with a mean straight carapace length of 52.5 $\pm$ \{SD\} 1.1 cm. Modified maximum likelihood methods were used to model mean residency of 873 d at the site, with c. 12 individuals present at any one time. Based on photogrammetry measurements, individuals at the site were found to be of immature age class. This, along with the extended residency times, indicates that the site could be an important developmental habitat. Photo-ID is a valid minimally invasive technique for identifying individual C. mydas for mark-recapture analyses. The use of paired laser photogrammetry for categorising the life-history stage of an aggregation of sea turtles is demonstrated for the first time. Identification of such developmental habitats through the employment of these minimally invasive techniques is useful for conservation of the species.},

We present estimates of demographic vital rates from a 43-year population study of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), a species endemic to alpine habitats in western North America. We used capture-recapture models to estimate annual rates of apparent survival, population growth, and recruitment for breeding-age ptarmigan, and we fit winter weather covariates to models in an attempt to explain annual variation. There were no trends in survival over the study period but there was strong support for age and sex effects. The average rate of annual growth suggests a relatively stable breeding-age population ( \{\$\}\{\$\} \{\$$\backslash$backslash\$\}bar\{\{\}\{\$$\backslash$backslash\$\}lambda \{\}\} \{\$\}\{\$\} \$$\backslash$lambda\$ \{\$$\backslash$backslash\$textasciimacron\} = 1.036), but there was considerable variation between years for both population growth and recruitment rates. Winter weather covariates only explained a small amount of variation in female survival and were not an important predictor of male survival. Cumulative winter precipitation was found to have a quadratic effect on female survival, with survival being highest during years of average precipitation. Cumulative winter precipitation was positively correlated with population growth and recruitment rates, although this covariate only explained a small amount of annual variation in these rates and there was considerable uncertainty among the models tested. Our results provide evidence for an alpine-endemic population that has not experienced extirpation or drastic declines. However, more information is needed to understand risks and vulnerabilities of warming effects on juveniles as our analysis was confined to determination of vital rates for breeding-age birds.},

Predictions of suitable habitat for the Vancouver Island subspecies varied from 370 to 1039 km2 based on field survey observations and from 404 to 1354 km2 based on public observations. All models had fair accuracy (kappa $\backslash$textgreater 0.45) when tested on an independent dataset, but Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models tended to over-predict ptarmigan occurrence, had the lowest accuracy, and were most sensitive to the type of response data used. All the machine learning modeling techniques differed little between the datasets. These comparable results are encouraging for the continued use of citizen science monitoring programs, which can save both time and expense while involving and educating the public about threatened species. We advocate the use of opportunistic citizen science data and machine learning modeling techniques (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, and Maxent) for predicting alpine vertebrate species distributions.},

  abstract = {Abstract For decision making processes related to a sustainable harvest, two aspects are of fundamental importance: first, the insufficient accuracy of abundance estimates and second, the fact that an increased mortality will not necessarily decrease the population size. To optimise decision making, we investigated how uncertainty, namely incomplete information and inadequate understanding about the conditions and the relationships between system components, affect the feasibility of population control. To this end, we developed an age-structured population model for roe deer, one of the most common ungulates in Europe. The model simulates hunting processes that are affected by uncertainties related to abundance estimates and species demography. The results indicated that uncertainty related to abundance estimates largely reduced the ability to achieve target population densities. Surprisingly, this effect was not weakened by more frequent estimations. We conclude that decreasing the interval of abundance estimates counterintuitively cannot compensate for lacking accuracy. This novel aspect should therefore be considered in the management of dynamic ecological systems.},

  abstract = {Bias in vital rate estimation may come from failing to meet a variety of assumptions during the stages of sampling, monitoring, and analysis, though most are not commonly addressed in published studies. Here, we pay specific attention to various forms of censoring and truncation that present challenges for telemetry-based monitoring of survival. We use simulations to assess how uncertainty about times of death and imperfect detection probabilities affect Kaplan\textendash{}Meier survival estimates. We then treat monitoring of threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in west-central Alberta as a case study to test for potential effects of non-random right censoring and interval censoring on survival estimates. We report that monitoring frequency (e.g., daily vs. monthly) and associated uncertainty about the exact time of death do not inherently induce bias on Kaplan\textendash{}Meier point estimates of survival nor affect estimates of variance. Removing individuals from the at-risk pool during intervals for which they were not detected did induce a negative bias on resulting survival estimates when the probability of detection was independent of the animals' fates. We recommend using subsequent detections to impute animals' fates during missed intervals in such cases when all animals' fates are eventually known or permanently right censored and when missed detections are not related to changes in mortality risk. Although some assumptions remain difficult to test and of continued concern, we find no evidence of biases in the methodology of Alberta's woodland caribou monitoring program. Our results lend credence to recent evidence of widespread declines in woodland caribou populations across the province. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Age ratios of trapped females were skewed towards young females relative to other studies, and the age ratio of trapped females was not different than the age ratio of the sample we collected by shooting.

Errors in species classification are often evident in such surveys, yet few statistical methods exist to properly account for them. In this paper, we examine biases that result from species misidentification when ignored, and we develop statistical models to provide unbiased estimates of density in the face of such errors. Our approach treats true species identity as a latent variable and requires auxiliary information on the misclassification process (such as informative priors, experiments using known species, or a double-observer protocol). We illustrate our approach with simulated census data and with double-observer survey data for ice-associated seals in the Bering Sea. For the seal analysis, we integrated misclassification into a model-based framework for distance-sampling data. The simulated data analysis demonstrated reliable estimation of animal density when there are experimental data to inform misclassification rates; double-observer protocols provided robust inference when there were ``unknown'' species observations but no outright misclassification, or when misclassification probabilities were symmetric and a symmetry constraint was imposed during estimation. Under our modeling framework, we obtained reasonable apparent densities of seal species even under considerable imprecision in species identification. We obtained more reliable inferences when modeling variation in density among transects. We argue that ecologists should often use spatially explicit models to account for differences in species distributions when trying to account for species misidentification. Our results support using double-observer sampling protocols that guard against species misclassification (i.e., by recording uncertain observations as ``unknown'').},

If unaccounted for, misclassification will lead to overly optimistic levels of precision and can cause biased estimates of age or stage structure. Although several studies have used information from known-age individuals to quantify errors in age or stage distribution, the problem of estimating the age or stage structure in face of such errors has received comparably little attention. In this paper, we describe a general statistical framework for estimating the true stage distribution of a sample when misclassification rates can be estimated. The estimation process requires auxiliary information on misclassification rates, such as data from individuals of known age. We analyze age-structured harvest records from black bears in Pennsylvania to illustrate how incorporating misclassification errors leads to changes in point estimates and provides a measure of precision.},

  abstract = {Here we analyze body mass index (BMI) data for children and adolescents from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Because of the lack of BMI values for a considerable number of the children and adolescents, and the differential probabilities of selection of these individuals, serious nonresponse and selection bias in inference can be present. To analyze the NHANES III BMI data, a nonignorable nonresponse model has been proposed to estimate the finite population means of small domains formed by crossing age, race and sex within counties. In this approach, the log-BMI values are used to obtain more normally distributed data, and the model includes a spline regression of log-BMI on age, adjusted for race, sex, and the interaction of race and sex. In this work, to assess the status of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents, our new model predicts the more informative finite population percentiles of BMI for these small domains, incorporating additional measures to minimize possible biases. These measures are the most appropriate transformation for the skewed BMI data, incorporation of an intraclass correlation within the households, and inclusion of selection probabilities into the nonignorable nonresponse model to reflect the higher probabilities of selection among black non-Hispanics and Hispanic-Americans. We also consider robustness and sensitivity to the assumptions of the nonignorable nonresponse model by fitting several versions of our proposed model, as well as a very different ignorable nonresponse model that uses a mixture of Student t densities, selection probabilities, and BMI values. It is noteworthy that in the likelihood-based inference literature, we have seen no work by others that includes both nonignorable nonresponse and nonignorable selection. Based on NHANES III data, we show that there are differences in the 85th or 95th percentile for overweight by county, race, and particularly age, and a small difference in sex.},

  abstract = {The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is one of the surveys used to assess one aspect of the health status of the U.S. population. One indicator of the nation's health is the total number of doctor visits made by the household members in the past year. We study the binary variable of at least one doctor visit versus no doctor visit by all household members to each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The proportion of households with at least one doctor visit is an indicator of the status of health of the U.S. population. There is a substantial number of non-respondents among the sampled households. The main issue we address here is that the non-response mechanism should not be ignored because respondents and non-respondents differ. The purpose of this work is to estimate the proportion of households with at least one doctor visit, and to investigate what adjustment needs to be made for non-ignorable non-response. We consider a non-ignorable non-response model that expresses uncertainty about ignorability through the ratio of odds of a household doctor visit among respondents to the odds of doctor visit among all households, and this ratio varies from state to state. We use a hierarchical Bayesian selection model to accommodate this non-response mechanism. Because of the weak identifiability of the parameters, it is necessary to `borrow strength' across states as in small area estimation. We also perform a simulation study to compare the expansion model with an alternative expansion model, an ignorable model and a non-ignorable model. Inference for the probability of a doctor visit is generally similar across the models. Our main result is that for some of the states the non-response mechanism can be considered non-ignorable, and that 95 per cent credible intervals of the probability for a household doctor visit and the probability that a household responds shed important light on the NHIS data.

  abstract = {Most demographic models explicitly track the dynamics of a single sex. However, single-sex models may lead to rather poor results when vital rates and other demographic parameters differ between the sexes. Consequently, the population may not be optimally managed if management measures are based on a single-sex model, which suggests the need for two-sex models. The consequences of ignoring sexual dimorphism and mating mechanisms when proposed management strategies are based on single-sex demographic models are illustrated for shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Analyses based on single-sex models would underestimate the probability of decline risk. The findings imply that management decisions should be based on sex-specific models to better achieve management goals. The mating mechanism principally affects the proportion of breeding females, which has a large impact on the perceived population growth rate. Which mating function best describes the dynamics of shortfin mako populations is still unknown. More research is needed to avoid making inaccurate management decisions, such as genetic paternity studies to clarify the mating mechanism for this species.},

As predicted by Holden in the early 1970s, many sharks and rays can be vulnerable to fishery mortality because they grow slowly, mature late in life, reproduce infrequently, have relatively low fecundities and can have relatively long life spans. As has now been found, however, not all species exhibit these traits. Also, ageing structures (neural arches and caudal thorns), other than vertebrae and spines, have since been evaluated. Various methods for validating age and growth estimates have been developed and tested on numerous species of elasmobranchs. These include tag\textendash{}recapture analyses, oxytetracycline injections, centrum or spine edge and marginal increment analyses, and bomb radiocarbon dating of calcified structures. Application of these techniques has sometimes not only validated relatively slow growth and long life span estimates, but also has produced other results. A brief historical perspective on the applications and limitations of these techniques for elasmobranchs is provided, along with a discussion of selected species for which these techniques worked well, did not work at all or have produced variable and conflicting results. Because many fishery management techniques utilize age or stage-specific information, often through demographic analyses, accurate information on the life histories of fished populations, especially age validation, is extremely important for the fishery management of these cartilaginous fishes.},

  abstract = {Theory recognizes that a treatment of the detection process is required to avoid producing biased estimates of population rate of change. Still, one of three monitoring programmes on animal or plant populations is focused on simply counting individuals or other fixed visible structures, such as natal dens, nests, tree cavities. This type of monitoring design poses concerns about the possibility to respect the assumption of constant detection, as the information acquired in a given year about the spatial distribution of reproductive sites can provide a higher chance to detect the species in subsequent years. We developed an individual-based simulation model, which evaluates how the accumulation of knowledge about the spatial distribution of a population process can affect the accuracy of population growth rate estimates, when using simple count-based indices. Then, we assessed the relative importance of each parameter in affecting monitoring performance. We also present the case of wolverines (Gulo gulo) in southern Scandinavia as an example of a monitoring system with an intrinsic tendency to accumulate knowledge and increase detectability. When the occupation of a nest or den is temporally autocorrelated, the monitoring system is prone to increase its knowledge with time. This happens also when there is no intensification in monitoring effort and no change in the monitoring conditions. Such accumulated knowledge is likely to increase detection probability with time and can produce severe bias in the estimation of the rate and direction of population change over time. We recommend that a systematic sampling of the population process under study and an explicit treatment of the underlying detection process should be implemented whenever economic and logistical constraints permit, as failure to include detection probability in the estimation of population growth rate can lead to serious bias and severe consequences for management and conservation.},

Precise estimates of demographic rates are key components of population models used to predict the effects of stochastic environmental processes, harvest scenarios and extinction probability. 2. We used a 12-year photographic identification library of whale sharks from Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia to construct Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model estimates of survival within a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) framework. Estimated survival rates, population structure and assumptions regarding age at maturity, longevity and reproduction frequency were combined in a series of age-classified Leslie matrices to infer the potential trajectory of the population. 3. Using data from 111 individuals, there was evidence for time variation in apparent survival (\&\#x3c6;) and recapture probability (p). The null model gave a \&\#x3c6;\&\#x302; of 0.825 (95\% CI: 0.727-0.893) and \$$\backslash$backslashhat\{p\} = 0.184\$ (95\% CI: 0.121-0.271). The model-averaged annual \&\#x3c6;\&\#x302; ranged from 0.737 to 0.890. There was little evidence for a sex effect on survival. 4. Using standardized total length as a covariate in the CMR models indicated a size bias in \&\#x3c6;. Ignoring the effects of time, a 5-m shark has a \$$\backslash$backslashhat\{$\backslash$backslashphi\} = 0.59\$ and a 9 m shark has \$$\backslash$backslashhat\{$\backslash$backslashphi\} = 0.81\$. 5. Of the 16 model combinations considered, 10 (63\%) indicated a decreasing population (\$$\backslash$backslashlambda $\backslash$textless 1\$). For models based on age at first reproduction (\&\#x3b1;) of 13 years, the mean age of reproducing females at the stable age distribution (A\&\#x304;) ranged from 15 to 23 years, which increased to 29-37 years when \&\#x3b1; was assumed to be 25. 6. All model scenarios had higher total elasticities for non-reproductive female survival [\$E(S\_\{nr\})\$] compared to those for reproductive female survival [\$E(S\_\{r\})\$]. 7. Assuming relatively slow, but biologically realistic, vital rates (\&\#x3b1; = 25 and biennial reproduction) and size-biased survival probabilities, our results suggest that the Ningaloo Reef population of whale sharks is declining, although more reproductive data are clearly needed to confirm this conclusion. Combining relatively precise survival estimates from CMR studies with realistic assumptions of other vital rates provides a useful heuristic framework for determining the vulnerability of large oceanic predators for which few direct data exist.},

However, in spite of recent development in monitoring protocols, there are gaps in our ability to accurately and quickly estimate numbers of individuals present, especially for the cryptic and often non-breeding components of structured vertebrate populations. Yet knowing the size and growth trajectory of all stage classes of a population is critical for species conservation. Here we use data from 2 years of non-invasive genetic sample collection from the cryptic, non-breeding component of an endangered bird of prey population to evaluate the impact of variability in population estimates on demographic models that underpin conservation efforts. A single non-invasive sample collection in 2003 conclusively identified 47 individual non-breeding imperial eagles, 2.8 times more than were visually counted. In 2004, our comprehensive genetic and observational analyses determined that 414 imperial eagles (n=308 non-breeders+68 territory holders+38 chicks) were present. This estimate was 326\% larger than the 127 birds visually observed (n=21 non-breeders+68 territory holders+38 chicks) and 265\% larger than the population size predicted by demographic models with the same number of breeders (n=156$\pm$7.2;$\pm$se). Our study builds on a body of work that demonstrates that conventional visual estimation of cryptic components of structured populations may not always be effective. Furthermore, we show that reliance on those estimates can result in inaccuracies in the demographic models that are often the foundation for subsequent conservation action.},

One hypothesized cause of this decline in productivity is a decline in male:female ratios during the breeding period. We examined Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW) deer and elk population composition data obtained from helicopter surveys to see whether sex ratios explained variation in young:female ratios. Data for both deer and elk supported a response of young:100 females ratios to the male:100 females ratios during the previous year. The observed ratios were about 0.25 fawns:100 does per 1 buck:100 does for deer (95\% CI \&\#xb1; 0.14) and 0.28 calves:100 cows per 1 bull:100 cows for elk (95\% CI \&\#xb1; 0.12). However, these effects were not adequate to explain the decline in fawn:doe (1.14 fawns:100 does per year) and calf:cow ratios (0.68 calves:100 cows per year) observed during 1975-1995. Differences in the sex ratio:productivity relationship observed between populations suggest that only some areas might show an increase in young:female ratios in response to an increase in male:female ratios, and then only a small increase in young:females was predicted. We did not detect a threshold of male:female ratios for either species that precipitated a drastic decline in productivity. Based on commonly employed population composition surveys, we conclude that increasing post-season sex ratios will have little if any impact on subsequent population productivity.},

  abstract = {N-mixture models have become a popular method for estimating abundance of free-ranging animals that are not marked or identified individually. These models have been used on count data for single species that can be identified with certainty. However, co-occurring species often look similar during one or more life stages, making it difficult to assign species for all recorded captures. This uncertainty creates problems for estimating species-specific abundance, and it can often limit life stages to which we can make inference. We present a new extension of N-mixture models that accounts for species uncertainty. In addition to estimating site-specific abundances and detection probabilities, this model allows estimating probability of correct assignment of species identity. We implement this hierarchical model in a Bayesian framework and provide all code for running the model in BUGS language programs. We present an application of the model on count data from two sympatric freshwater fishes, the brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and illustrate implementation of covariate effects (habitat characteristics). In addition, we used a simulation study to validate the model and illustrate potential sample size issues. We also compared, for both real and simulated data, estimates provided by our model to those obtained by a simple N-mixture model when captures of unknown species identification were discarded. In the latter case, abundance estimates appeared highly biased and very imprecise, while our new model provided unbiased estimates with higher precision. This extension of the N-mixture model should be useful for a wide variety of studies and taxa, as species uncertainty is a common issue. It should notably help improve investigation of abundance and vital rate characteristics of organisms' early life stages, which are sometimes more difficult to identify than adults.},

  doi = {10.1002/jwmg.108},
  abstract = {The Bathurst herd of barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) in the Canadian central arctic declined from an estimated 203,800 to 16,400 breeding females from 1986 to 2009, with the most rapid decline from 2006 to 2009. A key research and management question was whether the decline was mainly due to decreases in productivity alone or also due to reduced adult female survival. Investigating causes of the decline was hampered by a lack of direct estimates of caribou demographic parameters. We developed a demographic model that could be objectively fitted to field data to explore the mechanisms for the Bathurst decline, with a focus on the recent accelerated decline from 2006 to 2009. Our modeling indicated that the decline was driven by increasing negative trends in adult female and calf survival rates and possibly reduced fecundity The effect of a constant hunter harvest on the declining herd was one potential cause for the recent accelerated decline in adult survival. The demographic model detected negative trends in adult female survival that were not detected using standalone analyses of collar-based survival data. The model allowed rigorous interpretation of trends in productivity by controlling for the simultaneous influence of trends in adult, calf, and yearling survival and adult fecundity on field-based calf\textendash{}cow ratios. Stochastic simulations suggested that large increases in adult survival and productivity would be needed for the herd to recover. Our methods enable objective modeling of caribou demography that can assist in caribou management based upon all sources of available data. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

  doi = {10.1093/icb/icm030},
  abstract = {Sexual segregation is very common in vertebrates that live in groups. In this article, I will review proximate and ultimate causes of sexual segregation in social species and in particular in ungulates in which the bulk of research on the topic has been carried out. In most social ungulate species, males and females live in separate groups outside the breeding season, sometimes using different home ranges and types of habitat. In most of these species, males are larger than females. Dimorphism in body size can lead to sexual differences in ecology and behavior making it difficult for the two sexes to stay in the same group. It is important for our better understanding of the evolution of sociality, sexual dimorphism and different mating systems to determine why sexual segregation is so widespread not only in ungulates but also in other vertebrates. In this article, I discuss the ecology of the two sexes by reviewing proximate and ultimate causes of sexual segregation. To do this, I compare a range of studies of ruminants and include explanations for social segregation as well as for habitat segregation by gender. This leads into a review and updates current knowledge of the phenomenon. Although I present a number of different hypotheses, I focus in particular on predation risk, forage selection and activity budget and discuss the social-factors hypothesis. I stress that the key in solving the enigma of sexual segregation lies in clearly separating hypotheses that try to explain social segregation and habitat segregation, as well as in including experiments or model systems. To that end, I present a preliminary study on a test of the activity-budget hypothesis in three-spine sticklebacks and explain why I believe that shoaling fish are useful for analysing the underlying processes and mechanisms that lead to sexual segregation in animals. Lastly, I argue that it is unlikely that a single factor can explain social segregation or habitat segregation but that a model integrating different factors and different levels of segregation might succeed in describing proximate and ultimate causes of sexual segregation.},

We examined whether mountain lions (Puma concolor) selectively prey upon mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) infected with chronic wasting disease, a prion disease. We located kill sites of mountain lions in the northern Front Range of Colorado, USA, and compared disease prevalence among lion-killed adult ($\geq$2 years old) deer with prevalence among sympatric deer taken by hunters in the vicinity of kill sites. Hunter-killed female deer were less likely to be infected than males (odds ratios (OR) = 0.2, 95\% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.1\textendash{}0.6; p = 0.015). However, both female (OR = 8.5, 95\% CI = 2.3\textendash{}30.9) and male deer (OR = 3.2, 95\% CI = 1\textendash{}10) killed by a mountain lion were more likely to be infected than same-sex deer killed in the vicinity by a hunter (p \&lt; 0.001), suggesting that mountain lions in this area actively selected prion-infected individuals when targeting adult mule deer as prey items. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Royal Society},

In addition to reaffirming spatial heterogeneity among wintering mule deer subpopulations, we report marked differences in CWD prevalence by sex and age groups as well as clear local trends of increasing prevalence over a 7-yr period. Prevalence of CWD differed by age (yearling vs. adult), sex, and geographic area at two different spatial scales (game management unit or population unit winter range) and increased over time at both geographic scales. Disease status (positive or negative) was not independent of age for males (n = 285, df = 6, ?2 = 18.4, P = 0.005) or females (n = 387, df = 8, ?2 = 17.2, P = 0.028). Among males, prevalence increased and then declined across age classes, peaking in 5- to 6-yr-old individuals; among females, prevalence showed no definite age-related pattern. Demographic, spatial, and temporal factors all appear to contribute to the marked heterogeneity in CWD prevalence in endemic portions of northcentral Colorado, USA. These factors likely combine in various ways to influence epidemic dynamics on both local and broad geographic scales.},

  doi = {10.2307/2290350},
  abstract = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of "link function," which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with \$J $\backslash$textgreater 2\$ categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

In particular, it is widely held that population reduction, while effective for controlling diseases that are subject to density-dependent (DD) transmission, is ineffective for controlling diseases that are subject to frequency-dependent (FD) transmission. We investigate control for horizontally transmitted diseases with FD transmission where the control is via culling or harvest that is non-selective with respect to infection and the population can compensate through DD recruitment or survival. Using a mathematical model, we show that culling or harvesting can eradicate the disease, even when transmission dynamics are FD. Eradication can be achieved under FD transmission when DD birth or recruitment induces compensatory growth of new, healthy individuals, which has the net effect of reducing disease prevalence by dilution. We also show that if harvest is used simultaneously with vaccination, and there is high enough transmission coefficient, application of both controls may be less efficient than vaccination alone. We illustrate the effects of these control approaches on disease prevalence for chronic wasting disease in deer where the disease is transmitted directly among deer and through the environment.},

Evidence for negative delayed density dependence is found mainly in populations exhibiting monotonic deterministic stability, whereas evidence for positive delayed density dependence is found mainly in populations exhibiting damped or persistent two-point cycles, or more complex deterministic dynamics.

Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of density dependence interact with external influences on population dynamics. In particular, spatial heterogeneity in resources and the presence of capable predators may weaken feedbacks from density dependence to growth of populations. We used the Kalman filter to analyze 23 time series of estimates of abundance of northern ungulate populations arrayed along a latitudinal gradient (latitude range of 40$^\circ$\textendash{}70$^\circ$N) to evaluate the influence of spatial heterogeneity in resources and predation on density dependence. We also used contingency tables to test whether density dependence was independent of the presence of carnivores (our estimate of predation) and multiple regressions to determine the effects of spatial heterogeneity in resources, predation, and latitude on the strength of density dependence. Our results showed that the strength of density dependence of ungulate populations was low in the presence of large carnivores, particularly at northern latitudes with low primary productivity. We found that heterogeneity in elevation, which we assume acted as a surrogate for spatial heterogeneity in plant phenology, also reduced effects of density dependence. Thus, we show that external forces created by heterogeneity in resources and predation interact with internal feedbacks from population density to shape dynamics of populations of northern ungulates.},

Our objective is to critically examine the theoretical and empirical support for current models of CWD epizootiology, in light of herd health-management actions. We identify a critical, untested premise (i.e., strictly frequency-dependent transmission) that underlies the dire model predictions. We re-evaluate published comparisons of model output with field data and find little support for published model structures. Given the uncertainty surrounding the future effects of chronic wasting disease on deer and elk populations, and the potential costs of unnecessarily culling large numbers of charismatic and valuable animals, we propose that consideration of alternative models and management actions in a decision-theoretic framework is necessary for wildlife management actions to retain their scientific basis.},

To better understand effects of chronic wasting disease (CWD) and cougar (Puma concolor) pr\&\#xe9;dation, we studied mortality and recruitment of elk (Cervus elaphus) at Wind Cave National Park (WICA) during 2005-2009. We marked 202 elk (83 subadult M and 119 subadult and ad F) with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars, observed 28 deaths during 74,220 days of monitoring, and investigated 42 additional deaths of unmarked elk found dead. Survival rates were similar for males and females and averaged 0.863 (SE = 0.025) annually. Leading causes of mortality included hunting (0.065, SE = 0.019), CWD (0.034, SE = 0.012), and cougar pr\&\#xe9;dation (0.029, SE = 0.012). Marked elk killed by hunters and cougars typically were in good physical condition and not infected with CWD. Effects of mortality on population growth were exacerbated by low rates of pregnancy (subadults = 9.5\%, SE = 6.6\%; ad = 76.9\%, SE = 4.2\%) and perinatal survival (0.49, SE = 0.085 from 1 Feb to 1 Sep). Chronic wasting disease, increased pr\&\#xe9;dation, and reduced recruitment reduced the rate of increase for elk at WICA to approximately \&\#xeb; = 1.00 (SE = 0.027) during the past decade. Lower rates of increase are mitigating effects of elk on park vegetation, other wildlife, and neighboring lands and will facilitate population control, but may reduce opportunities for elk hunting outside the park.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a unique transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni). The natural history of CWD is incompletely understood, but it differs from scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) by virtue of its occurrence in nondomestic and free-ranging species. CWD has many features in common with scrapie, including early widespread distribution of disease-associated prion protein (PrPd) in lymphoid tissues, with later involvement of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. This distribution likely contributes to apparent efficiency of horizontal transmission and, in this, is similar to scrapie and differs from BSE. Clinical features and lesions of CWD are qualitatively similar to the other animal TSEs. Microscopically, marked spongiform lesions occur in the central nervous system (CNS) after a prolonged incubation period and variable course of clinical disease. During incubation, PrPd can be identified in tissues by antibody-based detection systems. Although CWD can be transmitted by intracerebral inoculation to cattle, sheep, and goats, ongoing studies have not demonstrated that domestic livestock are susceptible via oral exposure, the presumed natural route of exposure to TSEs. Surveillance efforts for CWD in captive and free-ranging cervids will continue in concert with similar activities for scrapie and BSE. Eradication of CWD in farmed cervids is the goal of state, federal, and industry programs, but eradication of CWD from free-ranging populations of cervids is unlikely with currently available management techniques.},

  abstract = {Human alteration of landscapes can affect the distribution, abundance, and behavior of wildlife. We explored the effects of human land use on the prevalence of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations residing in north-central Colorado. We chose best approximating models estimating CWD prevalence in relation to differences in human land use, sex, and geographic location. Prevalence was higher in developed areas and among male deer, suggesting anthropogenic influences on the occurrence of disease. We also found a relatively high degree of variation in prevalence across the three study sites, suggesting that spatial patterns in disease may be influenced by other factors operating at a broader, landscape scale. Our results suggest that multiple factors, including changes in land use, differences in exposure risk between sexes, and landscape-scaled heterogeneity, are associated with CWD prevalence in north-central Colorado.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has emerged as an important disease of wild and farmed cervids in North America. Of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, CWD is the only 1 found in free-ranging species. Because the TSEs include infamous diseases like bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease of humans, CWD by association has become a disease of interest beyond the parochial concerns where it is found. Consequently, wildlife managers are faced with developing programs for addressing CWD. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) are the only species known to be naturally susceptible to CWD. Although implications of CWD are not entirely clear at this time, we know that CWD is a fatal, contagious disease of mature reproductive segments of deer and elk populations. It has been endemic in free-ranging cervids in a core area of contiguous portions of southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado, USA, for a minimum of 20 years and probably longer. The known geographic distribution of endemic CWD is relatively limited at this time, although as results of intensified surveillance become available, this may change. Foci of CWD in free-ranging deer have been identified distant from the core endemic area as far east as Wisconsin. Distribution has greatly expanded in the last decade or more via commerce in infected farmed elk; as a result, CWD recently has been found in multiple jurisdictions of the plains, foothills, and Rocky Mountains of western North America, and in South Korea. Studies of the biology and natural history of CWD over the last few years have resulted in a better understanding of its pathogenesis and epidemiology. Chronic wasting disease is transmitted horizontally from infected to susceptible cervids. Early involvement of alimentary tract-associated lymphoid tissues during incubation suggests plausible routes for transmission via feces or saliva. Residual environmental contamination also appears to be important in sustaining epidemics. Studies of CWD epidemiology led to development of models to help explain the history of CWD as well as forecast its impacts on deer and elk populations. Improved tests allow CWD to be diagnosed early in incubation, long before clinical signs appear. Where CWD is not known to occur, managers should be, and in some cases are, developing surveillance programs and regulations that prevent or reduce the likelihood that CWD will be introduced into their jurisdictions. Where CWD is already endemic, responsible agencies are conducting surveillance to assess status and trends in prevalence and geographic distribution, managing deer and elk populations to limit spread, and developing and evaluating techniques for further controlling and perhaps eradicating CWD. Programs for addressing the challenges of CWD management will require interagency cooperation, commitment of funds and personnel, and applied research.},

  abstract = {Arctic foxes Vulpes lagopus (L.) display a sharp 3- to 5-year fluctuation in population size where lemmings are their main prey. In areas devoid of lemmings, such as Iceland, they do not experience short-term fluctuations. This study focusses on the population dynamics of the arctic fox in Iceland and how it is shaped by its main prey populations. Hunting statistics from 1958\textendash{}2003 show that the population size of the arctic fox was at a maximum in the 1950s, declined to a minimum in the 1970s, and increased steadily until 2003. Analysis of the arctic fox population size and their prey populations suggests that fox numbers were limited by rock ptarmigan numbers during the decline period. The recovery of the arctic fox population was traced mostly to an increase in goose populations, and favourable climatic conditions as reflected by the Subpolar Gyre. These results underscore the flexibility of a generalist predator and its responses to shifting food resources and climate changes.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of a wild red-legged partridge population were examined over a 14-year period in Spain to identify patterns in age and sex ratios in relation to weather parameters, and to assess the importance of these parameters in population dynamics and management. The results gave age ratios of 1.07 (but 2.13 in July counts), juvenile sex ratios of 1.01 and adult sex ratios of 1.47. Overall, 12\% more females were hatched and female juvenile mortality was 7.3\% higher than in males. Sex differential mortality explains the 19.2\% deficit in adult females, which are more heavily predated than males during the breeding period. Accordingly, age ratios are dependent on sex ratios and both are density dependent. Over time, ratios and density changes appear to be influenced by weather and management. When the habitat is well conserved, partridge population dynamics can be explained by a causal chain: weather operates on net primary production, thereby affecting partridge reproduction and predation and, as a result, age and sex ratios in the October population. A reduction in the impact of predation (i.e. the effects of ground predators on eggs, chicks and breeding females) is the key factor to improve the conservation of partridge populations and associated biological processes.},

  abstract = {Diffusion approximation (DA) methods provide a powerful tool for population viability analysis (PVA) using simple time series of population counts. These methods have a strong theoretical foundation based on stochastic age-structured models, but their application to data with high sampling error or age-structure cycles has been problematic. Recently, a new method was developed for estimating DA parameters from highly corrupted time series. We conducted an extensive cross-validation of this new method using 189 long-term time series of salmon counts with very high sampling error and nonstable age-structure fluctuations. Parameters were estimated from one segment of a time series, and a subsequent segment was used to evaluate the predictions regarding the risk of crossing population thresholds. We also tested the theoretical distributions of the estimated parameters. The distribution of parameter estimates is an essential aspect of a PVA because it allows one to calculate confidence levels for risk metrics. This study is the first data-based cross-validation of these theoretical distributions. Our cross-validation analyses found that, when parameterization methods designed for corrupted data sets are used, DA predictions are very robust even for problematic data. Estimates of the probability of crossing population thresholds were unbiased, and the estimated parameters closely followed the expected theoretical distributions.},

  volume = {46},
  issn = {00218901},
  abstract = {1. Trends of animal populations are of great interest in ecology but cannot be directly observed owing to imperfect detection. Binomial mixture models use replicated counts to estimate abundance, corrected for detection, in demographically closed populations. Here, we extend these models to open populations and illustrate them using sand lizard Lacerta agilis counts from the national Dutch reptile monitoring scheme. 2. Our model requires replicated counts from multiple sites in each of several periods, within which population closure is assumed. Counts are described by a hierarchical generalized linear model, where the state model deals with spatio-temporal patterns in true abundance and the observation model with imperfect counts, given that true state. We used WinBUGS to fit the model to lizard counts from 208 transects with 1\textendash{}10 (mean 3) replicate surveys during each spring 1994\textendash{}2005. 3. Our state model for abundance contained two independent log-linear Poisson regressions on year for coastal and inland sites, and random site effects to account for unexplained heterogeneity. The observation model for detection of an individual lizard contained effects of region, survey date, temperature, observer experience and random survey effects. 4. Lizard populations increased in both regions but more steeply on the coast. Detectability increased over the first few years of the study, was greater on the coast and for the most experienced observers, and highest around 1 June. Interestingly, the population increase inland was not detectable when the observed counts were analysed without account of detectability. The proportional increase between 1994 and 2005 in total lizard abundance across all sites was estimated at 86\% (95\% CRI 35\textendash{}151). 5. Synthesis and applications. Open-population binomial mixture models are attractive for studying true population dynamics while explicitly accounting for the observation process, i.e. imperfect detection. We emphasize the important conceptual benefit provided by temporal replicate observations in terms of the interpretability of animal counts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  doi = {10.1007/s11121-007-0070-9},
  abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) are the two most common approaches to missing data analysis. In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information ($\gamma$) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which $\gamma$ and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on $\gamma$, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.},

  abstract = {Population indices quantify changes in relative population sizes, which underpin much of basic ecology and conservation science. However, temporal changes in population counts may vary among survey sites for both ecological and artificial reasons, confounding existing population indices estimated without accounting for such variations. We created a smoothed hierarchical model, and compared its performance against the conventional approaches (generalized linear models and generalized additive models) and a non-smoothed hierarchical model using simulation data with a known nonlinear trend. The smoothed hierarchical model always estimated population indices with the best accuracy and precision; the performance of other models deteriorated substantially with increasing variation in trends of population counts among sites, causing inaccurate estimation of population growth rates. The estimated variations in trends of population counts among sites for 233 out of 518 North American breeding bird species were larger than the value used in the simulation where there was a considerable difference in the performance between hierarchical models and the conventional approaches. These estimated variations in trends of population counts among sites were particularly large in gregarious waterbirds. These results suggest that the smoothed hierarchical model developed in this study should play an important role in accurately assessing population indices, particularly for gregarious waterbirds, using count data from large-scale, long-term surveys in the field.},

  abstract = {The use of hunting statistics for population monitoring has often been criticized because such data are affected by several sources of error. Still, for many harvested populations, hunting statistics are the only available data source and cautious use of such data may be valuable for management. Here we assessed to what extent long-term monitoring of Svalbard rock ptarmigan spring densities and hunting statistics (bag size and proportion of juveniles in the hunting bag) reflect similar population fluctuations. We found a decreasing trend in both bag size and proportion of juveniles in the bag, but no trend in ptarmigan spring densities. However, annual fluctuations of ptarmigan spring density and bag size were correlated. Together, these time series indicate that both population abundance (bag size) and recruitment (proportion of juveniles in the bag) are decreasing, but the reproductive component fraction (density of territorial males) is not yet compromised. This biological interpretation remains, however, uncertain due to lack of hunting effort data. Monitoring programs using hunting statistics should therefore critically discuss and evaluate what the hunting statistics reflect and fine-tune the hunter data collection to obtain maximum biological relevance. Still, our results illustrate that the combination of population estimates and hunting statistics can provide more nuanced information about the population status than the density estimates alone.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an invariably fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Despite a 100\% fatality rate, areas of high prevalence, and increasingly expanding geographic endemic areas, little is known about the population-level effects of CWD in deer. To investigate these effects, we tested the null hypothesis that high prevalence CWD did not negatively impact white-tailed deer population sustainability. The specific objectives of the study were to monitor CWD-positive and CWD-negative white-tailed deer in a high-prevalence CWD area longitudinally via radio-telemetry and global positioning system (GPS) collars. For the two populations, we determined the following: a) demographic and disease indices, b) annual survival, and c) finite rate of population growth ($\lambda$). The CWD prevalence was higher in females (42\%) than males (28.8\%) and hunter harvest and clinical CWD were the most frequent causes of mortality, with CWD-positive deer over-represented in harvest and total mortalities. Survival was significantly lower for CWD-positive deer and separately by sex; CWD-positive deer were 4.5 times more likely to die annually than CWD-negative deer while bucks were 1.7 times more likely to die than does. Population $\lambda$ was 0.896 (0.859\textendash{}0.980), which indicated a 10.4\% annual decline. We show that a chronic disease that becomes endemic in wildlife populations has the potential to be population-limiting and the strong population-level effects of CWD suggest affected populations are not sustainable at high disease prevalence under current harvest levels.},

  abstract = {In large-herbivore populations, environmental variation and density dependence co-occur and have similar effects on various fitness components. Our review aims to quantify the temporal variability of fitness components and examine how that variability affects changes in population growth rates. Regardless of the source of variation, adult female survival shows little year-to-year variation [coefficient of variation (CV $\backslash$textless10\%)], fecundity of prime-aged females and yearling survival rates show moderate year-to-year variation (CV $\backslash$textless20\%), and juvenile survival and fecundity of young females show strong variation (CV $\backslash$textgreater30\%). Old females show senescence in both survival and reproduction. These patterns of variation are independent of differences in body mass, taxonomic group, and ecological conditions. Differences in levels of maternal care may fine-tune the temporal variation of early survival. The immature stage, despite a low relative impact on population growth rate compared with the adult stage, may be the critical component of population dynamics of large herbivores. Observed differences in temporal variation may be more important than estimated relative sensitivity or elasticity in determining the relative demographic impact of various fitness components.},

  abstract = {Population regulation is a fundamental process related to most phenomena in ecology, including evolutionary ecology. I review the conceptual basis for defining regulation as bounded fluctuations in abundance, in contrast to the unbounded fluctuations of random-walk populations. Regulation arises as a result of potentially stabilizing density-dependent processes, even when brought about by "non-equilibrium" mechanisms. Although the phenomena is unambiguous in theory, detecting regulation by finding evidence for density dependence in a series of population estimates faces unsolved statistical problems. So, while there is growing evidence for widespread regulation, severe detection problems remain. I illustrate these with data from bird populations. Whether regulation is typically achieved by local stabilizing mechanisms or via metapopulation dynamics remains to be determined. I summarize recent studies on a particularly well-regulated system\textendash{}red scale (Aonidiella aurantii) and its controlling parasitoid, Aphytis melinus. We tested and failed to find evidence for eight hypotheses that might account for the system's stability, including spatial heterogeneity in attack rates, a refuge, and metapopulation dynamics. We also failed to find evidence for density-dependent parasitism, but such density dependence might be still be present. Recent laboratory and modeling studies have uncovered a number of other potentially stabilizing mechanisms centering on the response of individual Aphytis to their size-structured host. This plethora of size- and stage-dependent interactions leads naturally to a consideration of the factors controlling Aphytis' size-dependent behavioral decisions, and consequently to the elaboration of size-structured models. The latter provide a vehicle for bringing together investigations of selection of life histories, and population dynamics. This is illustrated by a model of Aphytis and red scale dynamics that can explain a dramatic case of competitive displacement. The red scale/Aphytis system exemplifies a particularly challenging problem in population regulation, namely to account for the co-occurrence of stability and severe suppression of the prey population. A potentially generic solution is to assume stabilizing density dependence in the parasitoid or predator population; however, this has the consequence of increasing the host or prey population equilibrium. My colleagues and I have shown that observed prey densities in a plankton system are too low for such a mechanism to be operating. Further work is needed to test this and other hypotheses.},

  doi = {10.2307/3071969},
  abstract = {By definition, a population is regulated if it persists for many generations with fluctuations bounded above zero with high probability. Regulation thus requires density-dependent negative feedback whereby the population has a propensity to increase when small and decrease when large. Ultimately, extinction occurs due to regulating mechanisms becoming weaker than various disruptive events and stochastic variation. Population regulation is one of the foundational concepts of ecology, yet this paradigm has often been challenged, during the first half of the 20th century when the concept was not clearly defined, and more recently by some who study demographically open populations. The history of ecology reveals that earlier manifestations of the concept focused mostly on competition as the mechanism of population regulation. Because competition is often not evident in nature, it was sometimes concluded that population regulation was therefore also absent. However, predation in the broadest sense can also cause density dependence. By the 1950s, the idea that demographic density dependence was essential (but not sufficient) for population regulation was well established, and since then, challenges to the general concept have been short lived. However, some now believe that metapopulations composed of demographically open local populations can persist without density dependence. In particular, some recent manifestations of the Recruitment Limitation Hypothesis all but preclude the possibility of regulation. The theory of locally open populations indicates that persistence always relies on direct demographic density dependence at some spatial and temporal scale, even in models reportedly demonstrating the contrary. There is also increasing empirical evidence, especially in marine systems where competition for space is not self evident, that local density dependence is more pervasive than previously assumed and is often caused by predation. However, there are currently insufficient data to test unequivocally whether or not any persistent metapopulation is regulated. The challenge for more complete understanding of regulation of metapopulations lies in combined empirical and theoretical studies that bridge the gap between smaller scale field experiments and larger scale phenomena that can presently be explored solely by theory.},

  abstract = {Complex population processes may require equally complex models, which can lead to analytically intractable estimation problems. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a computational tool for parameter estimation in situations where likelihoods cannot be computed. Instead of using likelihoods, ABC methods quantify the similarities between an observed data set and repeated simulations from a model. A practical obstacle to implementing an ABC algorithm is selecting summary statistics and distance metrics that accurately capture the main features of the data. We demonstrate the application of a sequential Monte Carlo ABC sampler (ABC SMC) to parameter estimation of a general stochastic stage-structured population model with ongoing reproduction and heterogeneity in development and mortality. Individual variation in demographic traits has considerable consequences for population dynamics in many systems, but including it in a population model by explicitly allowing stage durations to follow a realistic distribution creates a complex model. We applied the ABC SMC to fit the model to a simulated representative data set with known underlying parameters to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. We also introduced a systematic method for selecting summary statistics and distance metrics, using simulated data and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves from classification theory. Evaluations suggest that the approach is promising for model inference in our example of realistic stage-structured population models.},

The model can be fit to data collected using a variety of standard survey methods such as repeated point counts in which removal sampling, double-observer sampling, or distance sampling is used during each count. Simulation studies demonstrated that parameter estimators are unbiased when temporary emigration is either "completely random" or is determined by the size and location of home ranges relative to survey points. We also applied the model to repeated removal sampling data collected on Chestnut-sided Warblers (Dendroica pensylvancia) in the White Mountain National Forest, USA. The density estimate from our model, 1.09 birds/ha, was similar to an estimate of 1.11 birds/ha produced by an intensive spot-mapping effort. Our model is also applicable when processes other than temporary emigration affect the probability of being available for detection, such as in studies using cue counts.

  abstract = {Multistate capture-recapture models are a natural generalization of the usual one-site recapture models. Similarly, individuals are sampled on discrete occasions, at which they may be captured or not. However, contrary to the one-site case, the individuals can move within a finite set of states between occasions. The growing interest in spatial aspects of population dynamics presently contributes to making multistate models a very promising tool for population biology. We review first the interest and the potential of multistate models, in particular when they are used with individual states as well as geographical sites. Multistate models indeed constitute canonical capture-recapture models for individual categorical covariates changing over time, and can be linked to longitudinal studies with missing data and models such as hidden Markov chains. Multistate models also provide a promising tool for handling heterogeneity of capture, provided states related to capturability can be defined and used. Such an approach could be relevant for population size estimation in closed populations. Multistate models also constitute a natural framework for mixtures of information in individual history data. Presently, most models can be fit using program MARK. As an example, we present a canonical model for multisite accession to reproduction, which fully generalizes a classical one-site model. In the generalization proposed, one can estimate simultaneously age-dependent rates of accession to reproduction, natal and breeding dispersal. Finally, we discuss further generalizations - such as a multistate generalization of growth rate models and models for data where the state in which an individual is detected is known with uncertainty - and prospects for software development.

  abstract = {The classical maximum entropy (ME) approach to estimating the unknown parameters of a multinomial discrete choice problem, which is equivalent to the maximum likelihood multinomial logit (ML) estimator, is generalized. The generalized maximum entropy (GME) model includes noise terms in the multinomial information constraints. Each noise term is modeled as the mean of a finite set of a priori known points in the interval [-1, 1] with unknown probabilities where no parametric assumptions about the error distribution are made. A GME model for the multinomial probabilities and for the distributions associated with the noise terms is derived by maximizing the joint entropy of multinomial and noise distributions, under the assumption of independence. The GME formulation reduces to the ME in the limit as the sample grows large or when no noise is included in the entropy maximization. Further, even though the GME and the logit estimators are conceptually different, the dual GME model is related to a generalized class of logit models. In finite samples, modeling the noise terms along with the multinomial probabilities results in a gain of efficiency of the GME over the ME and ML. In addition to analytical results, some extensions, sampling experiments, and an example based on real-world data are presented.},

Estimating the parameters of these models is an important step in applying them to real populations. Multistate capture-recapture methods have provided a useful means for estimating survival and parameters of transition between locations or life history states but have mostly relied on the assumption that the state occupied by each detected animal is known with certainty. Nevertheless, in some cases animals can be misclassified. Using multiple capture sessions within each period of interest, we developed a method that adjusts estimates of transition probabilities for bias due to misclassification. We applied this method to 10 years of sighting data for a population of Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) in order to estimate the annual probability of transition from nonbreeding to breeding status. Some sighted females were unequivocally classified as breeders because they were clearly accompanied by a first-year calf. The remainder were classified, sometimes erroneously, as non-breeders because an attendant first-year calf was not observed or was classified as more than one year old. We estimated a conditional breeding probability of 0.31 \&\#xb1; 0.04 (estimate \&\#xb1; 1 SE) when we ignored misclassification bias, and 0.61 \&\#xb1; 0.09 when we accounted for misclassification.},

  abstract = {Understanding population dynamics is of great interest in many different contexts. Traditionally, population dynamics have often been considered in terms of individual-based demographic parameters (e.g., abundance, survival, and reproductive rates), estimation of which generally requires information from marked individuals. Alternatively, in some situations, it may be appropriate to consider population dynamics at a landscape level where the focus is shifted from numbers of individuals to the status of the population at places on the landscape. One consequence of doing so is that information from marked individuals is no longer required. Recently developed methods allow the estimation of landscape-level population vital rates in the realistic situation where the current status of the population might be misclassified via field methods (e.g., because of imperfect detection). Here, we consider the case of the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) at the Eldorado study area in central Sierra Nevada, California, USA, where interest is in the occupancy rate of potential nesting territories, and in whether owls in an occupied territory successfully reproduced each year during 1997\textendash{}2004. We analyzed the data using multistate occupancy models and found no evidence of annual variation in dynamic occupancy probabilities. There was strong evidence of annual variation in successful reproduction, with the pattern of variation being different depending on whether there was successful reproduction in the territory in the previous year. Of the three environmental variables considered, the Southern Oscillation Index appeared to be most important and explained some of the annual variation in reproduction probabilities.},

In matrix population models, populations are described with discrete classes of individuals (age, life history stage or size). To calibrate these models, longitudinal data are collected at the individual level to estimate demographic parameters. However, several sources of uncertainty can complicate parameter estimation, such as imperfect detection of individuals inherent to monitoring in the wild and uncertainty in assigning a state to an individual. Here, we show how recent statistical models can help overcome these issues. We focus on hidden process models that run two time series in parallel, one capturing the dynamics of the true states and the other consisting of observations arising from these underlying possibly unknown states. In a first case study, we illustrate hidden Markov models with an example of how to accommodate state uncertainty using Frequentist theory and maximum likelihood estimation. In a second case study, we illustrate state-space models with an example of how to estimate lifetime reproductive success despite imperfect detection, using a Bayesian framework and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. Hidden process models are a promising tool as they allow population biologists to cope with process variation while simultaneously accounting for observation error.},

We find that the modeling of the birth process in the general model is not consistent with the reduced death-only model and that all formulations to date lead to difficulties in imposing constraints upon the parameters of the birth process. We propose a generalization to the usual Jolly-Seber representation that models births using a multinomial distribution from a super-population. We show how this leads to simplifications in the numerical optimization of the likelihood and how constraints upon the parameters of the model can now be easily imposed. We show how covariate models using auxiliary variables such as sampling effort or weather conditions to explain capture or survival rates can also be easily added. We also show how this model can be generalized to more than one group of animals. Finally, a numerical example is provided which fits a class of models where the capture probabilities, survival probabilities, and birth probabilities can each vary over time or among groups or both. This permits sequential model fitting within a comprehensive model framework, an approach akin to that of Lebreton et al. (1992, Ecological Monographs 62, 67-118).},

  abstract = {Density dependence plays a key role in life-history characteristics and population ecology of large, herbivorous mammals. We designed a manipulative experiment to test hypotheses relating effects of density-dependent mechanisms on physical condition and fecundity of North American elk (Cervus elaphus) by creating populations at low and high density. We hypothesized that if density-dependent effects were manifested principally through intraspecific competition, body condition and fecundity of females would be lower in an area of high population density than in a low-density area. Thus, we collected data on physical condition and rates of pregnancy in each experimental population. Our manipulative experiment indicated that density-dependent feedbacks affected physical condition and reproduction of adult female elk. Age-specific pregnancy rates were lower in the high-density area, although there were no differences in pregnancy of yearlings or in age at peak reproduction between areas. Age-specific rates of pregnancy began to diverge at 2 years of age between the two populations and peaked at 6 years old. Pregnancy rates were most affected by body condition and mass, although successful reproduction the previous year also reduced pregnancy rates during the current year. Our results indicated that while holding effects of winter constant, density-dependent mechanisms had a much greater effect on physical condition and fecundity than density-independent factors (e.g., precipitation and temperature). Moreover, our results demonstrated effects of differing nutrition resulting from population density during summer on body condition and reproduction. Thus, summer is a critical period for accumulation of body stores to buffer animals against winter; more emphasis should be placed on the role of spring and summer nutrition on population regulation in large, northern herbivores.},

  abstract = {Ecological baseline areas are necessary benchmarks to detect slow change and predict fast change in ecosystems that humans depend upon. National parks, by default, fulfill this role provided they are large enough to maintain natural processes. They should be used to understand natural regulatory ecosystem processes that are then compared with other human-dominated systems. Natural regulation operates through negative feedback mechanisms in reproduction or mortality caused by factors such as food shortage and predation. Protected areas are capable of self-regulation as evidenced by many studies of such ecosystems covering several decades. They exhibit natural change, often with periodicities of decades or centuries, and such change must be accommodated in management plans. Ecosystems exhibit $\backslash$textgreater 1 natural state, often as a result of top-down processes such as predation and herbivory. These multistates are identified by their irreversibility when the cause of perturbations is removed. They are characterized by $\backslash$textgreater 1 combination of population densities and species. Predators may or may not be present, and herbivores may or may not impinge on the vegetation. Therefore, there is no single combination of species or ecosystem states for which management should strive. Naturalness, per se, is not the objective. Rather, the fundamental need is to compare ecosystems experiencing modern human impact with those in protected areas that are relatively free of such impacts so as to understand their consequences for mankind. The presence or absence of prehistoric humans is not relevant to these objectives. Management, however, should act to minimize disturbances, such as the presence of exotic species, within these ecological baselines. Monitoring of ecosystem change should be coordinated on a global basis, using simple and robust techniques.},

Suppose that observed frequencies f are a known linear transformation f=A${'}$x of a latent multinomial variable x with cell probability vector $\pi$=$\pi$(\$\th{}eta\$). Given that full conditional distributions [\$\th{}eta\$ | x] can be sampled, implementation of Gibbs sampling requires only that we can sample from the full conditional distribution [x | f, \$\th{}eta\$], which is made possible by knowledge of the null space of A${'}$. We illustrate the approach using two data sets with individual misidentification, one simulated, the other summarizing recapture data for salamanders based on natural marks.},

  abstract = {Age ratios (e.g., calf:cow for elk and fawn:doe for deer) are used regularly to monitor ungulate populations. However, it remains unclear what inferences are appropriate from this index because multiple vital rate changes can influence the observed ratio. We used modeling based on elk (Cervus elaphus) life-history to evaluate both how age ratios are influenced by stage-specific fecundity and survival and how well age ratios track population dynamics. Although all vital rates have the potential to influence calf:adult female ratios (i.e., calf:cow ratios), calf survival explained the vast majority of variation in calf:adult female ratios due to its temporal variation compared to other vital rates. Calf:adult female ratios were positively correlated with population growth rate (\&\#x3bb;) and often successfully indicated population trajectories. However, calf:adult female ratios performed poorly at detecting imposed declines in calf survival, suggesting that only the most severe declines would be rapidly detected. Our analyses clarify that managers can use accurate, unbiased age ratios to monitor arguably the most important components contributing to sustainable ungulate populations, survival rate of young and \&\#x3bb;. However, age ratios are not useful for detecting gradual declines in survival of young or making inferences about fecundity or adult survival in ungulate populations. Therefore, age ratios coupled with independent estimates of population growth or population size are necessary to monitor ungulate population demography and dynamics closely through time.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10651-009-0115-2},
  abstract = {The investigation of animal habitat selection aims at the detection of selective usage of habitat types and the identification of covariates influencing their selection. The results not only allow for a better understanding of the habitat selection process but are also intended to help improve the conservation of animals. Usually, habitat selection by larger animals is assessed by radio-tracking or visual observation studies, where the chosen habitat is determined for some animals at a set of specific points in time. Hence the resulting data often have the following structure: a categorical variable indicating the habitat type selected by an animal at a specific point in time is repeatedly observed and will be explained by covariates. These may either describe properties of the habitat types currently available and/or properties of the animal. In this paper, we present a general approach to the analysis of such data in a categorical regression setup. The proposed model generalizes and improves upon several of the approaches previously discussed in the literature. In particular, it accounts for changing habitat availability due to the movement of animals within the observation area. It incorporates both habitat- and animal-specific covariates, and includes individual-specific random effects to account for correlations introduced by the repeated measurements on single animals. Furthermore, the assumption that the effects are linear can be dropped by including the effects in nonparametric manner based on a penalized spline approach. The methodology is implemented in a freely available software package. We demonstrate the general applicability and the potential of the proposed approach in two case studies: The analysis of a songbird community in South-America and a study on brown bears in Central Europe.},

  abstract = {Ecologists use the relative abundance of fossil pollen in sediments to estimate how tree species abundances change over space and time. To predict historical forest composition and quantify the available information, we build a Bayesian hierarchical model of forest composition in central New England, USA, based on pollen in a network of ponds. The critical relationships between abundances of taxa in the pollen record and abundances as actual vegetation are estimated for the modern and colonial periods, for which both pollen and direct vegetation data are available, based on a latent multivariate spatial process representing forest composition. For time periods in the past with only pollen data, we use the estimated model parameters to constrain predictions about the latent spatio-temporal process conditional on the pollen data. We develop an innovative graphical assessment of feature significance to help to infer which spatial patterns are reliably estimated. The model allows us to estimate the spatial distribution and relative abundances of tree species over the last 2,500 years, with an assessment of uncertainty, and to draw inference about how these patterns have changed over time. Cross-validation suggests that our feature significance approach can reliably indicate certain large-scale spatial features for many taxa, but that features on scales smaller than 50 km are difficult to distinguish, as are large-scale features for some taxa. We also use the model to quantitatively investigate ecological hypotheses, including covariate effects on taxa abundances and questions about pollen dispersal characteristics. The critical advantages of our modeling approach over current ecological analyses are the explicit spatio-temporal representation, quantification of abundance on the scale of trees rather than pollen, and uncertainty characterization.},

Our approach models both source and mixture data simultaneously, and accounts for several different types of variation: these include measurement error on both the mixture and source data; variability in the sample from the source distributions; and variability in the mixing proportions themselves, generally of main interest. The method is an improvement on some existing methods in that estimates of mixing proportions (including their interval estimates) are sure to lie in the range [0, 1]; in addition, it is shown that our model can help in situations where identification of appropriate source data is difficult, especially when we extend our model to include a covariate. We first study the likelihood surface of a base model for a simple example, and then include prior distributions to create a Bayesian model that allows analysis of more complex situations via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling from the likelihood. Application of the model is illustrated with two examples using real data: one concerning chemical markers in plants, and another on water chemistry.},

  volume = {94},

  doi = {10.1890/12-0416.1},
  abstract = {Many ecological studies investigate how organisms use resources, such as habitats or foods, in relation to availability or other variables. Related statistical problems include analysis of proportions of species or genotypes in a community or population. These require statistical modeling of compositional count data: data on relative proportions of each category collected as counts. Common methods for analyzing compositional count data lack one or more important considerations. Some methods lack explicit accommodation of count data, dealing instead with proportions. Others do not handle between-sample heterogeneity for overdispersed data. Yet others do not allow general types of relationships between explanatory variables and resource use. All three components have been combined in a Bayesian framework, but for frequentist hypothesis tests and AIC model selection, maximum- likelihood estimation is needed. Here we propose the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution to accommodate overdispersed compositional count data. This approach can be used flexibly in combination with explanatory models, but the only correlations among compositional proportions that it can accommodate are the negative correlations due to the fact that proportions must sum to 1. Many existing models can be generalized to use the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution for residual variation, and the flexibility of the approach allows new hypotheses that have often not been considered in resource preference analysis, including that availability has no relation to use. We also highlight a new design for resource use studies, with multiple individual-use data sets from each of multiple sites, with different explanatory data for each site. We illustrate the approach with three examples. For two previously published habitat use data sets, we support the original conclusions and show that use is not unrelated to availability. For a data set of pollen collected by multiple bees from each of two sites, pollen use differs between the sites. Using bootstrap goodness-of-fit tests, we illustrate that the Dirichlet-multinomial is acceptable for two of the examples but unsuitable for one of the habitat use examples.},

  abstract = {Many species of sea turtles spend part of their life cycle gathered in large feeding aggregations that combine individuals from widely separated rookery populations. Biologists have applied methods of mixed-stock analysis to mitochondrial DNA samples from rookeries and mixed populations to estimate the contributions of different rookeries to the mixed stock. These methods are limited by the amount of genetic overlap between rookeries and fail to incorporate ecological covariates such as rookery size and location within major ocean currents that are strongly suspected to affect rookery contributions. A new hierarchical Bayesian model for rookery contributions incorporates these covariates (and potentially others) to draw stronger conclusions from existing data. Applying the model to various simple scenarios shows that, in some cases, it can accurately estimate turtle origins even when turtles come from rookeries with high degrees of genetic overlap. Applying the model to more complex simulations shows that it performs well in a wide range of scenarios. Applying the model to existing data on green turtles (Chelonia mydas) narrows confidence intervals but does not change point estimates significantly. Applying it to loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) strengthens the dominance of the large rookery in south Florida, and brings estimates from a small data set on sea turtle strandings into line with those from rookery data. Used appropriately, hierarchical Bayesian methods offer great potential for introducing multiple levels of variation and ecological covariates into ecological models.},

  volume = {25},
  abstract = {Private landowners are increasingly interested in managing deer on small parcels of land. Deer-proof fences have been used to facilitate management on small landholdings, but where public roads and streams cross, fences must have openings. These openings create questions regarding deer management. In western New York State, a 3-m-high fence with 5 openings was erected around a 319-ha area with the intent of enhancing management of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We investigated the impacts of the fence and management within enclosures on movements of deer, assessing their contributions to quality deer management (QDM) goals. We radiomarked 67 deer during winters of 1992-1995 and calculated emigration rates. Emigration of yearlings was substantially less than from unfenced populations (23\%), but through 30 months of age, 64\% had emigrated. Emigration of females was more limited (10\% through 30 months of age). Some deer moved in and out of the partial enclosure, and males suffered high mortality during hunting season as a consequence of this movement. Deer density estimates were $\backslash$textlesstex-math$\backslash$textgreater\$86$\backslash$backslash $\backslash$backslashtext\{deer\}/\{$\backslash$backslashrm km\}\^\{2\}\$$\backslash$textless/tex-math$\backslash$textgreater.

Harvest of males $\backslash$textgreater3 years of age increased from 0 to 6 from 1992 to 1994.

  volume = {30},
  abstract = {In 1995, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service adopted a protocol for the adaptive management of waterfowl hunting regulations (AHM) to help reduce uncertainty about the magnitude of sustainable harvests. To date, the AHM process has focused principally on the midcontinent population of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), whose dynamics are described by 4 alternative models. Collectively, these models express uncertainty (or disagreement) about whether harvest is an additive or a compensatory form of mortality and whether the reproductive process is weakly or strongly density-dependent. Each model is associated with a probability or "weight," which describes its relative ability to predict changes in population size. These Bayesian probabilities are updated annually using a comparison of population size predicted under each model with that observed by a monitoring program. The current AHM process is passively adaptive, in the sense that there is no a priori consideration of how harvest decisions might affect discrimination among models. We contrast this approach with an actively adaptive approach, in which harvest decisions are used in part to produce the learning needed to increase long-term management performance. Our investigation suggests that the passive approach is expected to perform nearly as well as an optimal actively adaptive approach, particularly considering the nature of the model set, management objectives and constraints, and current regulatory alternatives. We offer some comments about the nature of the biological hypotheses being tested and describe some of the inherent limitations on learning in the AHM process.},

  issn = {00917648, 19385463},
  abstract = {Wildlife managers in northwestern Colorado have had difficulty accurately estimating numbers of subadult male elk (Cervus elaphus) by sampling winter population densities and sex ratios. We investigated emigration and survival of telemetered 2-year-old male elk in a trophy hunting area in a northwestern Colorado Game Management Unit (GMU) to evaluate management strategies. We hypothesized that skewed numbers of males resulted from high subadult mortality or dispersal of subadult males. We used telemetered elk and Kaplan-Meier staggered entry methods to estimate emigration probability of 0.56 and 0.33 in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Maximum distances moved by emigrants from their capture point averaged 87 km (median = 79\&\#xb1;6.8 [SE]) in 1995 and 149 km (median = 136\&\#xb1;24.7) in 1996. Survival of emigrants was 0.25\&\#xb1;0.07 for both years combined. Resident survival was greater in both years at 0.89\&\#xb1;0.05. Our results suggest that elk movement between management areas in northwest Colorado is prevalent. Losses of males from the 2-year-old age cohort were attributed to high emigrant mortality and dispersal. Monitored elk dispersed throughout west-central Colorado and into parts of Utah and Wyoming. In addition, many harvested 2-year-old males had antlers that would have resulted in misclassification into older age categories by biologists during winter population surveys. We recommend conducting small-scale studies to identify local population dynamics, coordinate hunting seasons and population surveys, and align management boundaries with biological groups of elk.},

  abstract = {Large mammalian herbivores not only depend on plant communities for their existence but cause major changes in plant community composition and structure. These changes have direct consequences for ecosystem processes, but recent studies of ungulate-ecosystem relations show widely divergent ungulate effects in different ecosystems. We reviewed studies of ungulate effects on plant community composition to gain insight into potential mechanisms of ungulate-induced changes in both community composition and ecosystem processes. Our analysis of these studies is based on the premise that the effect ungulates exert on plant communities depends on the balance between (1) feeding selectivity of herbivores (i.e., degree to which different plant species or ecotypes experience different levels of tissue loss), and (2) differences among plant species in their ability to recover from tissue loss. A large number of studies clearly show that selective ungulate herbivory leads to the dominance of unpalatable, chemically defended plant species in communities. However, many studies have also demonstrated that intensive long-term herbivory does not lead to the invasion of unpalatable species into the community, and can even increase the dominance of highly palatable species. Our review indicates that high levels of nutrient inputs or recycling and an intermittent temporal pattern of herbivory (often due to migration) are key factors increasing the regrowth capacity of palatable species and hence maintaining their dominance in plant communities supporting abundant herbivores. Key factors limiting ungulate foraging selectivity, again limiting herbivore-induced dominance of slow-growing, unpalatable species, include herding behavior, early growing season and postfire herbivory, asynchronous phenology of palatable versus unpalatable species, and low relative abundance of unpalatable species. Our review indicates differences among ecosystems in the role played by ungulate herbivory result from the relative strength of these factors enhancing plant tolerance to herbivory and limiting foraging selectivity. Anthropogenic changes in these factors (e.g., alteration of migration patterns) therefore have the potential to significantly alter the effects of ungulates on plant communities and ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Partial migration is widespread in ungulates, yet few studies have assessed demographic mechanisms for how these alternative strategies are maintained in populations. Over the past two decades the number of resident individuals of the Ya Ha Tinda elk herd near Banff National Park has been increasing proportionally despite an overall population decline. We compared demographic rates of migrant and resident elk to test for demographic mechanisms partial migration. We determined adult female survival for 132 elk, pregnancy rates for 150 female elk, and elk calf survival for 79 calves. Population vital rates were combined in Leslie-matrix models to estimate demographic fitness, which we defined as the migration strategy-specific population growth rate. We also tested for differences in factors influencing risk of mortality between migratory strategies for adult females using Cox-proportional hazards regression and time-varying covariates of exposure to forage biomass, wolf predation risk, and group size. Despite higher pregnancy rates and winter calf weights associated with higher forage quality, survival of migrant adult females and calves were lower than resident elk. Resident elk traded high quality food to reduce predation risk by selecting areas close to human activity, and by living in group sizes 20\% larger than migrants. Thus, residents experienced higher adult female survival and calf survival, but lower pregnancy and calf weights. Cause-specific mortality of migrants was dominated by wolf and grizzly bear mortality, whereas resident mortality was dominated by human hunting. Demographic differences translated into slightly higher (2-3\%), but non-significant, resident population growth rate compared to migrant elk, suggesting demographic balancing between resident strategies during our study. Despite statistical equivalence, our results are also consistent with slow long-term declines in migrants because of high predation because of higher wolf-caused mortality in migrants. These results emphasize that migrants and residents will make different tradeoffs between forage and risk may affect the demographic balance of partially migratory populations, which may explain recent declines in migratory behavior in many ungulate populations around the world.

  abstract = {A factorial experiment was performed to evaluate the relationships between defoliation and canopy closure, recognizing that a major effect of grazing in nature is to prevent that closure. Short (Eustachys paspaloides) and mid-height (Themeda triandra) grasses from the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, were grown for 12 wk in a balanced factorial experiment. Treatments combined clipping and canopy closure, simulated by raising an opaque cardboard collar as plant height increased. At harvest, plants were separated into morphological parts, dried, weighed, and analyzed for nitrogen (N) and nonstructural carbohydrates (CHO). Simulated canopy closure of unclipped plants reduced photon flux density at the plant base by 12\% perpendicular to the light source and 55\% at a 45@? angle from the lights. Multivariate analysis revealed that experimental treatments produced completely distinct results. Simultated canopy closure of undefoliated plants more than doubled plant height, reduced tiller number by 65\% in the short grass and 90\% in the mid-height grass, converted differentiation from production of many small tillers to a few very large tillers, changed allocation patterns toward more stem and sheath, and shifted the short grass from a CHO-dominated economy to a more N-balanced economy. The time course of yield from defoliation reached a decided maximum at 9 wk in the short grass but was much lower and remained comparatively constant in the mid-height grass. Comparing clipped-unshaded plants (simulating grazing) with unclipped-shaded plants (simulating no grazing) revealed that, for both grasses, compensation for defoliation was complete in total yield, yield of live tissues, crown mass, root mass, and total number of leaves. Neither species compensated in residual leaf mass, total leaf area, leaf area per unit of plant biomass, or stem mass. Defoliation shifted leaves of both species to lower CHO and higher N concentrations. In general, the short grass was modified more by canopy closure, the mid-height species by clipping. Greater defoliation tolerance of the short-statured species was due to much greater tillering, significantly greater N accumulation, greater allocation to leaf blade and sheath, less allocation to crown and root, a greater foliage concentration per unit canopy volume, a lower rate of foliage death, and the ability to sustain a considerably higher leaf area per unit of plant mass. This experiment indicated that growing unclipped plants isolated in pots grossly distorts morphology, growth, and chemical properties compared to plants experiencing the canopy closure normally encountered in ungrazed grasslands. Therefore, failure to account for the self-limiting consequences of canopy closure can mislead conclusions from laboratory experiments designed to test the consequences of defoliation.},

  abstract = {A trophic cascade recently has been reported among wolves, elk, and aspen on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, but the mechanisms of indirect interactions within this food chain have yet to be established. We investigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors influencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent influence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken down into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Comparisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features influencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were influenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The influence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands $\backslash$textgreater open areas $\backslash$textgreater conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk for aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas. Our study clarifies the behavioral mechanisms involved in the trophic cascade of Yellowstone's wolf-elk-aspen system: elk respond to wolves on their winter range by a shift in habitat selection, which leads to local reductions in the use of aspen by elk.},

  abstract = {A substantial literature is reviewed which indicates that compensatory growth upon tissue damage by herbivory is a major component of plant adaptation to herbivores. Experiments in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park showed that net above-ground primary productivity of grasslands was strongly regulated by grazing intensity in wet-season concentration areas of the large ungulate fauna. Moderate grazing stimulated productivity up to twice the levels in ungrazed control plots, depending upon soil moisture availability. Productivity was maintained at control values even under very intense grazing, suggesting that conventional definitions of overgrazing may be inapplicable to these native plant-herbivore systems. A laboratory clipping experiment with a sedge abundant in one of the most intensely utilized regions resulted in a maximum net above-ground productivity of 11.6 g/m2 \&\#xb7; day when clipped daily at a height of 4 cm. Few plant species have been reported with the ability to maintain a significant level of productivity under such intense clipping. This suggests that the high grazing load of the Serengeti ecosystem has constituted strong selection on the plants for compensatory growth upon defoliation.},

Our objectives were to determine (1) how grazing history affected production, nitrogen uptake, and biomass and nitrogen allocation following defoliation and (2) how such responses were affected by competing neighbors of the same population. The growth chamber experiment was factorial with three main treatments in 12 possible combinations. Main treatments were: population (plants from lightly and heavily grazed sites), defoliation (three intensities), and competition (with or without neighbors of the same population). There were no significant interactions among treatments. OFF-colony plants produced 121\% as much biomass and their N. yield was 203\% as great as ON-colony plants. ON-colony plants allocated a higher percentage of biomass and N to the roots from OFF-colony plants, while the latter allocated a greater percentage of resources to leaf sheaths and reproductive structures. In response to defoliation, plants from the two populations had an average increase of 122\% in N uptake per unit of root biomass and a 141\% increase in total leaf-blade N yield. Heavily defoliated plants from both populations increased biomass and N allocation to blades, but total biomass production was substantially reduced. Intra-population competition reduced biomass production and N yield in individuals of both populations, but it did not affect total and aboveground N concentrations (per unit biomass) or N uptake per unit of root biomass. Our results support the hypothesis that genetically based morphological and physiological differentiation has occurred in B. gracilis as a result of strong selection pressures from grazing mammals on prairie dog colonies. We suggest the ON-colony population displays a strategy that reduces grazing severity rather than a @'grazing tolerance@' response to aboveground herbivory.},

  abstract = {Three general hypotheses have been proposed to explain why many large herbivores have highly aggregated patterns of distribution: dilution of predation risk, maintenance of forage in an immature but highly nutritious growth stage, and ideal free distribution in relation to spatial variation in either forage quality or primary productivity, Evaluation of the latter two hypotheses has been hampered by lack of a formal theoretical framework for assessing the effects of forage quality on resource acquisition by herbivores. A model is proposed that demonstrates how trade-offs between instantaneous intake and forage digestibility might lead to optimal rates of energy intake at iow to intermediate levels of forage abundance. Simulations based on the energy-intake model suggest a number of key environmental factors that should determine the impact of forage maturation and spatial variation on herbivore distribution patterns. All of the proposed advantages of aggregation may have general applicability, but the relative importance of each probably varies according to the specific circumstances facing a given herbivore population},

  abstract = {We examined the effect of native large herbivores on aboveground primary production of nonforested habitat in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Productivity of vegetation grazed by elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) was compared with that of ungrazed (permanently fenced) vegetation at four sites. Two methods were used that, we believed, would provide the most accurate measurements under the different grazing regimes encountered in the study. Production of ungrazed vegetation in permanent exclosures (10 \&\#xd7; 10 m or 15 \&\#xd7; 15 m, 3 per site) and that of vegetation that was grazed only in the winter was taken as peak standing crop. Production of vegetation grazed during the growing season was the sum of significant increments (P $\backslash$textless 0.05) in standing crop inside temporary exclosures (1.5 \&\#xd7; 1.5 m, 6 per site) moved every four weeks to account for herbivory. Aboveground productivity of grazed vegetation was 47\% higher than that of ungrazed vegetation across sites (P $\backslash$textless 0.0003). This result could be explained by either a methodological or grazer effect. We believe it was the latter. Results from a computer simulation showed that sequential sampling with temporary exclosures resulted in a slight underestimation of production, suggesting that the reported differences between treatments were conservative. We suggest that stimulation of aboveground production by ungulates may be, in part, due to the migratory behavior of native ungulates that track young, high quality forage as it shifts spatially across the Yellowstone ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Plant responses to herbivory and links to belowground nitrogen cycling were investigated at Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota. Laboratory estimates of net nitrogen mineralization were highest in soils from the more altered areas of prairie dog colonies (Cynomys ludovicianus) and lowest in the adjacent, lightly grazed, uncolonized grassland. The ratio of CO"2: net nitrogen mineralized, as index of immobilization, was highest in the uncolonized grassland and lowest in the altered core areas. Soil moisture was an important modifier of in situ field estimates of net nitrogen mineralization. Root biomass, an important carbon source for decomposers in perennial grasslands, was lowest in the altered core area and highest in the adjacent uncolonised grassland. Decreased nitrogen immobilization and increased net nitrogen mineralization in the laboratory incubations likely resulted from decreased root carbon inputs in grazed areas, which limited carbon availability to decomposers. Such increases in plant-available nitrogen may partially explain the frequently reported grazing-induced increases in shoot nitrogen concentrations. These studies suggest that carbon allocation to roots is a key link determining nitrogen-cycling responses to herbivory.},

  abstract = {(1) The responses of herbaceous vegetation on upland steppe of Yellowstone National Park's northern winter range to winter grazing by elk were investigated during 1987-88 using exclosures erected at four sites in 1958-62. (2) Elk winter-grazing on plants reduced standing dead material and litter biomass at most but not all sites and dates. Plant productivity was not reduced. (3) Live above-ground grass biomass was reduced by winter grazing at one of four sites in 1987 and at three sites in 1988. Live grass was more abundant in grazed areas at two sites in 1987 (4) Live forb biomass was c. 33\% of grass biomass, and was not affected by grazing in 1987, but increased slightly outside exclosures in 1988, perhaps because of the dry summer. (5) Root biomass was not affected by grazing at any site. (6) Nitrogen concentrations of live grass, dead grass and Artemisia frigida were increased by winter grazing. Total N flow to herbivores in 1987 would consequently have been stimulated by herbivory, and in 1988 would have been depressed by herbivory, only one-third as much as biomass. (7) The net effects of winter grazing appeared to be a redirection of biomass flow from decomposers into elk, accompanied by an enhanced rate of N recycling back to elk. The fact that perennial root biomass has persisted best indicated the net consequences of winter grazing for these plants.},

  abstract = {In most of their arctic and subarctic ranges reindeer, caribou and muskoxen adopt generalist foraging strategies; they consume a wide variety of plants even though they feed selectively. This paper analyses some aspects of selective feeding behavior and its possible influence on animal production. Selective feeding that makes only small changes in quality or amount of food intake may cause a greatly enhanced, or multiplier, effect on animal production. In an example for reindeer grazing in arctic coastal tundra during summer, selective grazing increased digestibility by 14\% and dry matter intake by 27\%, which combined to give a 268\% increase in projected daily weight gain. Weight gain may then influence populations through control over conception rate and survival during winter. An increase by 14\% in bodyweight of young female reindeer during summer results in a 35\% increase in the probability of conception in autumn. Winter range conditions can affect birth weight, milk production and calf growth rates, all of which affect future reproduction and survival and provide additional avenues for multiplier effects. /// \&\#x41d;\&\#x430;

  abstract = {We recorded food selection by free-ranging kudus (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), impalas (Aepyceros melampus), and domestic goats in the Nylsvley Nature Reserve in South Africa. The predominant vegetation is a deciduous wooded savanna growing on infertile sandy soils; patches of Acacia savanna occur on the more fertile sites of former human settlements. Woody species fall into two basic categories of acceptability to the animals: (1) species favored year-round; and (2) species generally rejected, except during certain periods. Among the latter, some species increase in acceptability during the dry season; others are favored temporarily while new leaves predominate. Some species remain low in acceptability year-round. We propose a palatability classification of woody species, considering features of leaf retention (deciduous vs. evergreen) and spinescence, as well as seasonal variations in acceptability. Estimated annual foliage losses to browsing ungulates were 1-3\% for unpalatable deciduous species, compared with 10-30\% for most palatable unarmed deciduous and evergreen species. Unpalatable deciduous species dominate the woody foliage biomass on the infertile soils, while palatable but spinescent species make up most of the leaf biomass of trees and shrubs on the more fertile sites. These patterns seem widely typical of African savanna. Plants known to have chemical defenses against vertebrate herbivory are prominent on nutrient-deficient soils, while those with structural defenses are prominent on fertile soils.},

Based on energy requirements of a 200-kg elk, winter-range carrying capacity was 1,481 \&\#xb1; 261 animals during Year 1 and 991 \&\#xb1; 102 during Year 2. Nitrogen-based estimates were similar to energy-based predictions: 1,674 \&\#xb1; 270 elk (Year 1) and 994 \&\#xb1; 101 (Year 2). Individual habitat types differed in carrying capacity. Willow (Salix spp.), wet meadow, and wet shrub meadow could support the most elk; aspen (Populus sp.) and mesic meadow were intermediate in carrying capacity; and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), grassland, and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-shrub could carry the fewest animals. Sensitivity analysis showed predictions of the range supply-animal demand model of nutritional carrying capacity to be strongly influenced by small changes in elk metabolic fecal nitrogen excretion rates. We conclude that the temporal variation in carrying capacity is important in managing harvest of elk populations and in planning future carrying-capacity research, and that estimates of nutritional carrying capacity are viable habitat evaluation procedures, particularly when used for comparative purposes.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. The effect of livestock on African rangelands has been a major focus of recent research, but little attention has been paid to the way livestock affects the distribution and availability of soil nutrients. In East African savannas, overnight containment of livestock in thorn-scrub corrals or 'bomas' concentrates large quantities of nutrients into small areas, potentially altering the landscape distribution of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in soils and plants. 2. This study was designed to (i) measure the density, turnover rates and soil nutrient concentrations of abandoned cattle bomas on nutrient-poor rangeland in central Kenya; (ii) determine whether long-term glades dominated by Cynodon plectostachyus are derived from abandoned bomas; and (iii) evaluate the effect of cattle bomas on the landscape-level distribution of N and P. 3. In the study area, glades ($\backslash$textgreater 39 years old) averaged 0.71 ha in size and occurred at a density of 0.71 km-2. Abandoned bomas (1-39 years since abandonment) averaged 0.39 ha and occurred at a density of 1.21 km-2. During 1961-2000, no glades reverted to bushland vegetation, while 53 bomas were abandoned. 4. All characteristics of soils measured across a boma-glade chronosequence indicated glades were indeed derived from abandoned bomas. Soil N, P and organic matter quality in the surface (0-15 cm) layer were similar for glades and 30-39-year-old bomas, but were significantly enriched relative to surrounding bushland. In contrast, at 40-65 cm depth beneath bomas, glades and bushland, soil N was similar. The texture of surface soils from bomas, glades and bushland was similar, indicating glades were not derived from a unique parent material. 5. Leaves of C. plectostachyus from 12-24-year bomas and long-term glades were enriched in P, calcium (Ca) and N relative to leaves of Cynodon dactylon from nearby bushland sites. In particular, P in boma and glade grass was above recommended levels for growing and lactating livestock, while P content of bushland grass was lower than recommended levels. 6. Cattle management via bomas exerts a greater effect on the distribution of P relative to N within the landscape. For cattle grazing an area of 20-25 km2 boma-1, an estimated 0.24-0.30 g N m-2 year-1 is removed from the rangeland and deposited into bomas. Within 1.5 years of boma abandonment, 70\% of this N is already lost from the manure and upper soil layer. Permanent N loss does occur via leaching, but the majority is probably volatilized and redistributed in rainfall. N deposition in rainfall (0.43 g N m-2 year-1) is more than sufficient to offset losses due to cattle grazing and deposition in bomas. In contrast, P deposited in bomas is more tightly retained, creating small P-enriched 'hotspots' while causing a permanent loss of the order of 0.021-0.026 g P m-2 year-1 from the surrounding bushland landscape. 7. Synthesis and applications. Results indicate that abandoned bomas persist as nutrient-enriched patches for at least four decades. Rangeland managers should recognize that the placement and relocation rate of current bomas influences the long-term distribution and availability of nutritionally important forage for livestock and wildlife. Future assessments of African rangeland stability should incorporate not only direct effects of livestock and rainfall on vegetation, but also the spatial effects of livestock management on soil and plant nutrients.},

Fire and herbivory effects on the nutritive quality of savanna vegetation can occur directly, independent of changes in the plant community, or indirectly, via effects on the plant community. Indirect effects can be further subdivided into those occurring because of changes in plant species composition or plant abundance (i.e., quality versus quantity). We studied relationships between fire, herbivory, rainfall, soil fertility, and leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sodium (Na) at 30 sites inside and outside of Serengeti National Park. Using structural equation modeling, we asked whether fire and herbivory influences were largely direct or indirect and how their signs and strengths differed within the context of natural savanna processes. Herbivory was associated with enhanced leaf N and P through changes in plant biomass and community composition. Fire was associated with reduced leaf nutrient concentrations through changes in plant community composition. Additionally, fire had direct positive effects on Na and nonlinear direct effects on P that partially mitigated the indirect negative effects. Key mechanisms by which fire reduced plant nutritive quality were through reductions of Na-rich grasses and increased abundance of Themeda triandra, which had below-average leaf nutrients.},

  abstract = {1. Herbivores, edaphic features and fire are primary factors regulating the balance between woody and herbaceous vegetation in savannas. Many observational studies have evaluated the potential effects of browsing herbivores on woody plant dynamics in African savannas, but few experimental studies have compared the dynamics of African savannas with and without browsers. 2. A replicated herbivore exclusion experiment was used to assess the role that native ungulates play in regulating woody plant dynamics on commercial rangeland in central Kenya, where the indigenous fauna have been allowed to coexist with cattle. 3. Exclusion of native browsing ungulates for just 3 years showed that they have dramatic effects at every scale from individual twig growth rates to overall rates of woody biomass accumulation in the ecosystem. 4. At the scale of individual Acacia twigs, browsers significantly reduced leaf density, leaf biomass and growth rates of twigs $\backslash$textless 50 cm above-ground (within the foraging height of dik-diks Madoqua kirkii ), but browsers had no effects on twig leaf density or leaf biomass at a height of 1$\cdot$0\textendash{}1$\cdot$25 m above-ground. 5. Reductions in the growth rate of twigs within the foraging height of dik-diks was associated with a 6-fold reduction in the rate at which shrubs $\backslash$textless 0$\cdot$5-m tall were recruited into the 0$\cdot$5 \textendash{}1$\cdot$5 m height class. This reduced recruitment combined with measured rates of shrub mortality in larger height classes shows that browsers reduced the rate of increase in shrub density nearly to zero (7$\cdot$1 $\pm$ 10$\cdot$2 shrubs ha - 1 year - 1 ) compared to the rapid rate of increase in the absence of browsers (136$\cdot$9 $\pm$ 13$\cdot$6 shrubs ha - 1 year - 1 ). 6. Damage to shrub canopies by elephants Loxodonta africana caused large, significant reductions in cover of A. mellifera and Grewia tenax , but lesser reductions in cover of A. etbaica . For Acacias , elephant damage was focused on shrubs $\backslash$textgreater 2$\cdot$5 m tall, such that Acacias in intermediate height classes (0$\cdot$5\textendash{}2$\cdot$5 m) experienced minimal browser impacts. Elephants influenced shrubland dynamics by altering shrub height-class distributions, shifting species composition from broad-leaved Grewia tenax to fine-leaved Acacia species, and suppressing woody biomass accumulation; but elephants had little influence on changes in shrub density. 7. Synthesis and applications . Our results suggest that a community of native browsers that includes both small, selective species (e.g. dik-diks) and large, bulk-feeding species (elephants) can provide an important ecosystem service by suppressing shrub encroachment on commercial rangeland.},

  abstract = {Potential competition between native and domestic herbivores is a major consideration influencing the management and conservation of native herbivores in rangeland ecosystems. In grasslands of the North American Great Plains, black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are widely viewed as competitors with cattle but are also important for biodiversity conservation due to their role in creating habitat for other native species. We examined spatiotemporal variation in prairie dog effects on growing-season forage quality and quantity using measurements from three colony complexes in Colorado and South Dakota and from a previous study of a fourth complex in Montana. At two complexes experiencing below-average precipitation, forage availability both on and off colonies was so low (12-54 g/m2) that daily forage intake rates of cattle were likely constrained by instantaneous intake rates and daily foraging time. Under these dry conditions, prairie dogs (1) substantially reduced forage availability, thus further limiting cattle daily intake rates, and (2) had either no or a small positive effect on forage digestibility. Under such conditions, prairie dogs are likely to compete with cattle in direct proportion to their abundance. For two complexes experiencing above-average precipitation, forage quantity on and off colonies (77-208 g/m2) was sufficient for daily forage intake of cattle to be limited by digestion rather than instantaneous forage intake. At one complex where prairie dogs enhanced forage digestibility and [N] while having no effect on forage quantity, prairie dogs are predicted to facilitate cattle mass gains regardless of prairie dog abundance. At the second complex where prairie dogs enhanced digestibility and [N] but reduced forage quantity, effects on cattle can vary from competition to facilitation depending on prairie dog abundance. Our findings show that the high spatiotemporal variation in vegetation dynamics characteristic of semiarid grasslands is paralleled by variability in the magnitude of competition between native and domestic grazers. Competitive interactions evident during dry periods may be partially or wholly offset by facilitation during periods when forage digestibility is enhanced and forage quantity does not limit the daily intake rate of cattle.},

  abstract = {Catchment characteristics and disturbances control the conditions and processes found in stream ecosystems. We examined nutrient cycling linkages between riparian soils and adjacent streams and the impacts of the removal of ungulate grazing on these ecosystems and processes at six grazing exclosure sites in the Valles Caldera National Preserve, NM, USA. The exclusion of native and domestic ungulate grazers for 3 yr significantly increased the riparian aboveground biomass of standing vegetation (273 plus or minus 155 in grazed vs. 400 plus or minus 178 g.m-2 in exclosures) and litter (58 plus or minus 75 in grazed vs. 110 plus or minus 76 g.m-2 in exclosures) (P=0.003 and 0.006, respectively). Except for an increase in total soil phosphorous (P) at three of the six sites, soil nutrient values were minimally affected by grazing after five growing seasons. Within the six sites studied, no connection was found between 0-15-cm depth soils, which were P-limited based on stoichiometric ratios, and stream nutrient availability or limitation, which were nitrogen limited. Stream geomorphology was not significantly altered by 5 yr of grazing exclusion. The elimination of grazing suppressed instream nutrient processing with significantly longer NH4 uptake lengths (P=0.003). These results suggest the exclusion of ungulate grazing impacts terrestrial characteristics (increased standing vegetative biomass) that are linked to ecosystem services provided by adjacent aquatic ecosystems (reduced N-uptake). Management plans should carefully balance the positive effect of grazing on stream nutrient processing and retention reported here with the well-documented grazing-related loss of other ecosystem services such as decreased fish and aquatic invertebrate habitat and effects on water-quality parameters such as turbidity and water temperature. Las caracteristicas del escurrimiento y los disturbios contralan las condiciones y procesos encontrados en ecosistemas de arroyos. Examinamos la relacion del ciclo de nutrientes entre suelos ripiaros y arroyos adyacentes y el impacto de la remocion de ungulados pastoreando en esos ecosistemas y procesos en seis sitios excluidos al pastoreo en Valles Caldera National Preserve, NM, USA. La exclusion de ungulados nativos y exoticos pastoreando, por tres anos incremento significativamente la biomasa aerea de la vegetacion (273 plus or minus 155 en pastoreo vs. 400 plus or minus 178 g - m-2 en exclusiones) y mantillo (58 plus or minus 75 en pastoreo vs. 110 plus or minus 76 g . m-2 en exclusiones) (P = 0.003 and 0.006, respectivamente). A excepcion de un incremento total de fosforo (P) en el suelo en tres de los seis sitios, los valores de nutrientes del suelo fueron minimamente afectados por el pastoreo despues de cinco temporadas de pastoreo. Dentro de los seis sitios estudiados, no se encontro conexion entre 0 a 15 cm de profundidad del suelo, las cuales fueron limitadas en P basados en proporciones estequiometricas, y la disponibilidad de nutrientes del arroyo o limitaciones las cuales fueron limitadas en nitrogeno. La geomorfologia del arroyo no fue significativamente alterada por los cinco anos de exclusion al pastoreo. La eliminacion del pastoreo suprimio el proceso de nutrientes dentro del arroyo con significativamente mayor duracion en la absorcion de NH4 (P = 0.003). Estos resultados sugieren que la exclusion de ungulados pastoreando impacta las caracteristicas terrestres (incremento en la biomasa de la vegetacion de pie) que esta relacionada a los servicios que provee el ecosistema por ecosistemas acuaticos adyacentes (reduccion de absorcion de N). Los planes de manejo deberan equilibrar cuidadosamente el efecto positivo del pastoreo en procesado de nutrientes en los arroyos y la retencion reportada aqui con la bien documentada perdida de otros servicios del ecosistema por pastoreo tales como la disminucion del habitat de peces e invertebrados acuaticos y efectos en parametros de calidad del agua como la turbidez y temperatura del agua.},

  abstract = {Due primarily to anthropogenic influences such as land use change, exotic species introductions, livestock grazing, altered hunting regimes, and predator control, wild ungulate populations have undergone tremendous shifts in recent decades. Although the result has been endangerment or extirpation in some regions, ungulate numbers have increased to locally or regionally high levels in other areas, causing shifts in plant species composition, problems for forest regeneration, and conflict with humans and domestic livestock. Our ability to find solutions to these problems is limited because we lack sufficient understanding of how ungulate species interact with predators, habitat, forage, competing species, and humans at multiple scales from small foraging patches to large regions. To bring together new findings in this area, encompassing various scales and foci of investigation, an international conference on "Forest Dynamics and Ungulate Herbivory" was held from 3 to 6 October 2001 in Davos, Switzerland. We provide a synthetic overview of the papers contained in this Special Issue, arising from that conference. A companion Special Issue of the Journal for Nature Conservation is devoted to the more management-oriented aspects of forest-ungulate interactions, entitled "Forest-Ungulate Interactions: Monitoring, Modeling and Management." From the papers in this issue, a number of important generalizations emerge to guide our understanding and further research. Our predictive understanding of foraging ecology needs to be generalized and scaled up, if it is to become useful for predicting the consequences of herbivory for broad-scale vegetation dynamics. Further, it is important to move beyond single-factor studies, to embrace the complexity of ungulate-vegetation interactions. The direction and magnitude of ungulate influences can be difficult to gauge because of complex interactions among species, structural units of vegetation or landscapes, ecosystem processes, and natural disturbances. Researchers need to look beyond the simplistic concept of "game damage", and comprehensively address the direct and indirect effects of ungulates on communities, ecosystems and landscapes. This may require a more systems-oriented, and less species-oriented approach. Ungulate-vegetation interactions need to be better understood over multiple scales, and particularly at the coarser scales that are of interest to managers and policy-makers. Finally, a long-term view of ungulate-vegetation interactions, where past, present, and future effects are considered in their appropriate temporal context, is absolutely essential. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Ecosystem ecologists traditionally have focused their attention on direct interactions among species, particularly those interactions that control flows of energy and materials among trophic levels. Emerging evidence suggests that indirect interactions may be more important than direct ones in determining ecosystem patterns and processes. Here I review indirect effects of ungulates on nutrient cycling, net primary production, and disturbance regimes in terrestrial ecosystems. Ungulates influence the nitrogen (N) cycle by changing litter quality, thereby affecting conditions for N mineralization, and by adding readily available N to upper levels of the soil in urine and feces. As a result of these additions, natural heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of N within landscapes is amplified by ungulate selection of habitats and patches. The magnitude of returns of plant N to the soil in urine and feces is a function of animal body mass and characteristics of the diet, particularly N content and levels of tannin. Effects on N cycling can cascade throughout the ecosystem, and can stabilize or destabilize the composition of plant communities. Net primary production can increase or decline in response to ungulate grazing. The direction of this response depends on the intensity of grazing or browsing, the evolutionary history of the ecosystem, and the opportunity for regrowth. Opportunity for regrowth is determined by physiological and morphological characteristics of the plant as well as environmental conditions, particularly the extent and timing of moisture availability. Ungulates influence fire regimes by altering the quality and quantity of fuels available for combustion. In grasslands, ungulates often reduce the extent, frequency, and intensity of fires, while in shrublands and forests, their effects can increase the likelihood of crown fires, while reducing the likelihood of surface fires. I develop the case that the way that ungulates influence ecosystem process is contingent on historical context, in particular the long-term context provided by plant-animal coevolution and soil development and the short-term context created by climate and weather. I show that ungulates are important agents of change in ecosystems, acting to create spatial heterogeneity, modulate successional processes, and control the switching of ecosystems between alternative states.

  volume = {26},
  issn = {00917648},
  abstract = {Natural regulation of native ungulates was initiated in 1968 in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) based on the premise that ungulates would reach an equilibrium with their plant resources. The natural-regulation management model stated: density dependence will regulate ungulates (i.e., a dynamic equilibrium will result between ungulates and their food supply, within some bounds of vegetation and soil effects); and no retrogression of soil and vegetation will occur from elk (Cervus elaphus) grazing during this process. The historical record indicated that elk were abundant in the system and elk were primarily food limited before settlement by European man (i.e., wolves [Canis lupus] and Native Americans were only an adjunct to the density dependent population regulation of ungulates). Density dependence was demonstrated in elk, but not in bison (Bison bison). No widespread evidence of overgrazing was observed through 1993 in study sites within vegetation communities that comprised about 97\% of the winter range. No evidence of increased exotics, increased sediment yield, warming or drying of the soil, changes in soil nutrients, or differences in aboveground standing-crop biomass of plants was found between grazed and ungrazed plots. Ungulate herbivory apparently stimulated aboveground production of grasses, enhanced nitrogen and macronutrients in grasses, increased nutrient cycling, and enhanced measures of fitness in 6 common plants. However, exposed soil surface (bare ground and pebbles combined) was 11-18\% greater on grazed than ungrazed plots, apparently due to a 71\% decline in dead and standing litter on grazed plots. Percent live-plant basal cover, however, did not differ on grazed versus ungrazed plots, and there was no difference in soil microclimate or sediment yield. Differences in the abundance of 12\% of the herbaceous species were found in grazed versus ungrazed sites (16 of 128 species); 10 were declines and 6 were increases. Willow (Salix spp.) and aspen (Populus tremuloides) declines predated the new management policy, but their slow declines also continued after 1968. Three uncommon plant species (aspen, willow, and Wyoming big sagebrush [Artemisia tridentata tridentata]) and 1 herbivore (moose [Alces alces]) declined under natural-regulation management. Two uncommon species of woody browse (aspen, Wyoming big sagebrush) were overutilized by ungulates (consumption of $\backslash$textgreater2/3 current annual growth occurred). We conclude the natural-regulation model for YNP was flawed in its assumptions of a single, steady state for the park, based on conditions presumed to exist in 1870 prior to establishment of the national park. The period selected as a standard (1870) was an unusual period characterized by frequent large fires and floods, common wolves, few elk, and a cooler, wetter climate. We also conclude there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding what elk densities were in pre-Columbian times (element 3 of the management model) and what effects wolves and Native Americans had in regulating the elk population.},

  abstract = {Ungulates can profoundly alter the structure and composition of forest communities via both direct and indirect mechanisms. Individual plant species often respond in a unique way to the direct effect of herbivory as a function of their sensitivity to browse damage, ungul ate food preferences, and the density of ungulates present. Sustained browsing pressure can limit the regeneration of favored and susceptible woody plants and eliminate populations of favored or susceptible herbaceous plants. These losses, in turn, give rise to indirect effects via trophic cascades or physical habitat modification. These indirect effects affect many other plant and animal populations. In the mixed conifer-hardwood forests around the Great Lakes in North America, widespread habitat modification and the extirpation of native predators and other ungulates have acted to boost populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to historically high densities. Such densities have curtailed regeneration of several important conifers (e.g. Tsuga canadensis and Thuja occidentalis) as evidenced by demographic analysis. Deer also appear to limit regeneration of Quercus and Betula in many areas. Impacts on understory herbs are harder to assess, but baseline data from 50 years ago indicate that these communities are changing in a pattern that implicates deer: grasses, sedges, and some ferns are increasing while overall herb diversity is declining. Thus, deer are playing a keystone role in these communities. We are currently assessing an additional set of questions, including: How best can we measure and represent ungulate impacts? At which densities do deer threaten forest diversity? How do impacts depend on initial plant and ungulate densities? Which species emerge as 'winners' or 'losers' in heavily-browsed landscapes? What characteristics or traits make a species susceptible to ungulate herbivory? How do ungulates affect patterns of diversity and relative abundance in ecological communities? What are the pathways by which ungulates exert indirect effects on species? and How significant are indirect effects? ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The response of willow to browsing was analyzed in the elk winter range of Rocky Mountain National Park, by considering the effect of elk browsing on Salix monticola Bebb, one of the most common willow species in this area. Unbrowsed and browsed treatments were established during the 1997 growing season (May to October), using eight long-term exclosures built in the fall of 1994. Plants in the browsed treatment were in the areas open to browsing, but they were protected from browsing by small exclosures during the experimental period. Winter browsing by elk induced the following measured responses in plant morphology and development: (I)higher shoot biomass production but similar leaf biomass and leaf area per plant, (2) a lower number of and bigger shoots, (3) a lower number of and bigger leaves, and (4) flower inhibition. In addition, we infer that browsing induces (5) lower belowground allocation and (6) a more negative N balance but a higher soil N uptake. We conclude that elk browsing negatively affects willow even though willow compensate for aboveground biomass removal. Continuous browsing produces long-term changes in willow morphology which constrain plant growth and development. High browsing utilization, as occurred in this experiment, could therefore reduce the competitive ability and survivorship of willow, in particular under drier environmental conditions},

  abstract = {Numerous investigator have suggested that herbivores almost always increase rates of nutrient and energy flow through terrestrial ecosystems by returning to the soil fecal material and urine with faster turnover rate than shed plant litter. These previous theories and models always treat the producer compartment as a homogenous pool. Essentially, they assume that consumers feed through a pureed cream of vegetable soup. However, many field observations and experiments have shown that consumers feed selectively (i.e., in a cafeteria) and that consumer choice is made on the same chemical basis that determines decomposition rates. Plants that are preferred food sources often have higher nutrient content, higher growth rates, and faster decomposition rates. As consumption reduces dominance of these species in favor of unpreferred species with slower decomposition, rates of nutrient cycling and energy flow should therefore decline. We analyze a model in which the consumer is given a choice among producers that vary in nutrient uptake rates, rates of nutrient return to decomposers, and consumer preference, and which is parameterized for plants and consumers characteristic of boreal regions. In this model, in an open, well-mixed system with one consumer and two such producers, the nutrient/energy flow will not exceed that of a system without the consumer. If the consumer has a choice between two such producers, it must choose one plant over the other at a greater ratio than that between the two plants in uptake and decay rates. In contrast, in a closed system the consumer must be less selective to coexist with the two plants. The system behavior is determined by the level of nutrient return through the consumer and the differences between the plants in nutrient uptake rates and consumer preference. Species richness affects properties of this model system to the extent that species are functionally distinct (i.e., have different rate constants) in a multivariate space o of life history traits (i.e., nutrient uptake and palatability). We suggest that the biochemical variability of plant tissues that simultaneously determines both consumer preference and decomposition rates is an essential feature of food webs that cannot be ignored. Thus, ecosystem models should, at minimum, consider more than one producer type with consumer preference.},

  abstract = {Clones of a C"4 sedge, Kyllinga nervosa Steud., from a semiarid location in the Serengeti region of Tanzania were propagated vegetatively and grown at 12-h photoperiods, 30@?C maximum daytime temperature and 15@? minimum nighttime temperature, simulating conditions at the native site. Clipping height, clipping frequency, nitrogen concentration of the nutrient medium, and watering frequency were varied in an unbalanced factorial experiment. Plants were harvested after 5 mo of sustained treatment. Each yield component was principally regulated by a different environmental factor. Yield to grazers (amount clipped off) was controlled by nitrogen supply, yield to producers (residual biomass) was controlled by water, and yield to decomposers (litter and standing dead) was controlled by clipping height and nitrogen. Plant growth was stimulated by defoliation. Plants overcompensated for amounts removed at moderate defoliation at high nitrogen, undercompensated at severe defoliation, and just compensated under other conditions. Therefore, increments of energy flow to grazers can be additive in ecosystem budgets due to compensatory growth of affected plants. The most important mechanisms accounting for compensatory growth of K. nervosa were activation of plant meristems and stimulated rates of leaf elongation in defoliated plants. Allocation of residual plant biomass to various organs was virtually independent of environment, indicating genetic control of physiological processes tending to balance allocation over a broad environmental range.},

  abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity of soil resources, particularly nitrogen availability, affects herbaceous-layer cover and diversity in temperate forest ecosystems. Current hypotheses predict that ungulate herbivores influence nitrogen availability at the stand scale, but how ungulates affect nitrogen availability at finer spatial scales that are relevant to the herb layer is less understood. We tested the hypothesis that ungulate exclusion reduces the spatial complexity of nitrogen availability at neighborhood scales (1-26 m) apart from mean stand scale effects. This outcome was expected due to a lack of ungulate nitrogenous waste deposition within exclosures and seasonally variable ungulate habitat use. To test this hypothesis we examined spatial patterning of ammonium and nitrate availability, herb-layer cover and diversity, and under-canopy solar radiation using geostatistical models. Our study sites included six stands of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) forest: three where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were excluded and three that were accessible to deer. Where deer were present, patch sizes of ammonium availability, cover, and diversity were smaller compared to deer exclosures, whereas mean site-level effects were not significant. Within deer exclosures cover and solar radiation were more similar in patch size than were cover and nitrogen availability. Our results suggest that browsing ungulates affect spatial patterns of herb-layer cover and diversity through the excretion of nitrogenous wastes in small, discrete patches. Ungulate-excreted nitrogen deposition and herbivory were concentrated in the dormant season, allowing herb-layer plants a greater opportunity to benefit from nitrogen additions. Therefore, the impact of ungulates on nitrogen cycling in forest ecosystems varies with spatial scale and the seasonal timing of ungulate impacts. In this way, ungulates may function as a seasonally dependent link between fine-scale and landscape-level ecological processes.},

The plant community composition can be altered as animals feed on some species but not others, changing the biomass, production, and nutrient cycling of an entire ecosystem. We used four paired moose (Alces alces) exclosures and browsed plots (built between 1948 and 1950) on Isle Royale, Michigan, to examine the influence of moose on aboveground biomass, production, and annual litterfall of boreal vegetation in 1987. Tree biomass was significantly greater, shrub biomass was significantly less, and herb biomass was significantly less in exclosures than in browsed plots. Tree production was greater in exclosures than in browsed plots, but there was no difference in the production per unit biomass between exclosures and browsed plots. Shrub production in exclosures was similar to that of browsed plots. Litter production was greater in exclosures than in browsed plots, despite total vegetation biomass differences between paired plots. There was significantly greater herb litter produced I the browsed plots than in the explosures. Moose browsing prevented saplings of preferred species from growing into the tree canopy, resulting in a forest with fewer canopy trees and a well-developed understory of shrubs and herbs. In addition, browsing may have altered the eventual balance of white spruce (Pica glauca) was balsam fir (Abies balsam), causing an increase in the former and a decrease in the latter. Thus, browsing by moose influences the long-term structure and dynamics of the boreal forest ecosystem, which has important implications for forest ecosystem management, especially where the population dynamics of moose are regulated.},

  abstract = {Large mammalian herbivores in grassland ecosystems influence plant growth dynamics in many ways, including the removal of plant biomass and the return of nutrients to the soil. A 10-week growth chamber experiment examined the responses of Sporobolus kentrophyllus from the heavily grazed short-grass plains of Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, to simulated grazing and varying nitrogen nutrition. Plants were subjected to two clipping treatments (clipped and unclipped) and five nitrogen levels (weekly applications at levels equivalent to 0, 1, 5, 10, and 40 g N m(-2)), the highest being equivalent to a urine hit. Tiller and stolen production were measured weekly. Total biomass at harvest was partitioned by plant organ and analyzed for nitrogen and mineral element composition. Tiller and stolen production reached a peak at 3-5 weeks in unclipped plants, then declined drastically, but tiller number increased continually in clipped plants; this differential effect was enhanced at higher N levels. Total plant production increased substantially with N supply, was dominated by aboveground production, and was similar in clipped and unclipped plants, except at high nitrogen levels where clipped plants produced more. Much of the standing biomass of unclipped plants was standing dead and stem; most of the standing biomass of clipped plants was live leaf with clipped plants having significantly more leaf than unclipped plants. However, leaf nitrogen was stimulated by clipping only in plants receiving levels of N application above 1 g N m(-2) which corresponded to a tissue concentration of 2.5\% N. Leaf N concentration was lower in unclipped plants and increased with level of N. Aboveground N and mineral concentrations were consistently greater than belowground levels and while clipping commonly promoted aboveground concentrations, it generally diminished those belowground. Tn general, clipped plants exhibited increased leaf elemental concentrations of K, P, and Mg. Concentrations of B, Ca, K, Mg, and Zn increased with the level of N. No evidence was found that the much greater growth associated with higher N levels diminished the concentration of any other nutrient and that clipping coupled with N fertilization increased the total mineral content available in leaf tissue. The results suggest that plants can (1) compensate for leaf removal, but only when N is above a critical point (tissue N 2.8\%) and (2) grazing coupled with N fertilization call increase the quality and quantity of tissue available for herbivore removal.},

  abstract = {Improving understanding of the connections between vegetation, herbivory, and ecosystem function offers a fundamental challenge in contemporary terrestrial ecology. Using exclosures constructed during the late 1950s, we examined effects of grazing by wild and domestic herbivores on plant community structure, aboveground herbaceous primary production, and nutrient cycling at six sites in semi-arid, sagebrush rangelands during 2001-2002 in Colorado, USA. Enclosures provided three treatments: no grazing, grazing by wild ungulates only, and grazing by wild and domestic ungulates. Excluding all grazing caused an increase in shrub cover (F = 4.97, P = 0.033) and decrease in bare ground (F = 4.74, P = 0.037), but also a decrease in plant species richness (F = 6.19, P = 0.018) and plant diversity (F = 7.93, P = 0.008). Effects of wild ungulate grazing on plant cover and diversity were intermediate to the effects of combined domestic and wild grazing. Aboveground net primary production was higher in both grazed treatments than in the ungrazed one (F(wild + domestic) = 2.98, P = 0.0936 and F(wild only) = 3.55, P = 0.0684). We were unable to detect significant effects of grazing on other ecosystem states and processes including C:N ratios of standing crops, N mineralization potential, or nitrification potential. Best approximating models revealed positive correlation between N availability and herbaceous cover and a negative correlation between herbaceous primary production and the ratio of shrub-herb cover and plant diversity. We conclude that ungulate herbivory, including both wild and domestic ungulates, had significant effects on plant community structure and ecosystem function during this 42-year span. Responses to the wild ungulate treatment were consistently intermediate to responses to the no grazing and wild + domestic grazing treatments. However, we were unable to detect statistical difference between effects of wild ungulates alone and wild ungulates in combination with livestock.},

  abstract = {Within large grassland ecosystems, climatic and topographic gradients are considered the primary controls of soil processes. Ungulates also can influence soil dynamics; however the relative contribution of large herbivores to controlling grassland soil processes remains largely unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of native mi- gratory ungulates and variable site (``landscape'') conditions, caused by combined climatic and topographic variability, on grassland of the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park by determining soil C and N dynamics inside and outside 33\textendash{}37 yr exclosures at seven diverse sites. Sites included hilltop, slope, and slope bottom positions across a climatic gradient and represented among the driest and wettest grasslands on the northern winter range. We performed two experiments: (1) a 12-mo in situ net N mineralization study and (2) a long-term (62-wk) laboratory incubation to measure potential N mineral- ization and microbial respiration. Results from the in situ experiment indicated that average net N mineralization among grazed plots (3.8 g N m-2yr-1) was double that of fenced, ungrazed plots (1.9 g N m-2yr-1). Mean grazer enhancement of net N mineralization across sites (1.9 g N m-2yr-1) approached the maximum difference in net N mineralization among fenced plots (2.2 g N m-2yr-1), i.e., the greatest landscape effect observed. Furthermore, ungulates substantially increased between-site variation in mineralization; grazed grassland, 1 SD = 2.2 g N m-2yr-1, fenced grassland, 1 SD = 0.85 g N m-2yr-1. In the long-term incubation, potential microbial respiration and net N mineralization were positively related to total soil C and Ncontent, respectively. There was greater variation in potential respiration and net N mineralization early in the incubation, when labile material was processed, compared to late in the incubation, when more recalcitrant substrate was processed, suggesting that between-site variation in labile organic matter was greater than that of recalcitrant material. Herbivores improved the organic matter quality of soil, in- creasing the labile fractions and reducing the recalcitrant fractions. Grazers reduced C respired/N mineralized ratios, an index of microbial N immobilization, by an average of 21\%. However, the largest landscape influence on the immobilization index was 13-fold greater than the grazer effect. Given that the greatest landscape influence on in situ net mineralization (2.2 g N m-2yr-1) was similar to the average grazer impact on that rate (1.9 g N m-2yr-1 ), we hypothesize that the landscape effect on field N availability was primarily caused by variation in microbial immobilization, while the grazing effect was primarily due to stimulation of gross mineralization. These results indicate that the relative importance of ungulates in controlling soil N cycling may be more important than previously suspected for grasslands supporting large herds of migratory ungulates, and that the dominant mechanisms underlying the landscape and ungulate influences on soil mineral fluxes may differ.},

  abstract = {The effect of pastoral management on the standing crop biomass of large ungulates, an index of carrying capacity, is analysed at a regional level by using data compiled from published sources covering east and south Africa. The effect of primary production is controlled for by using two environmental factors, rainfall and soil nutrient availability, and the effect of species richness of the ungulate community is evaluated. The results confirm the dominant effect of rainfall, and demonstrate that soil nutrient levels also strongly affect the biomass of large ungulate communities. For a given level of rainfall, on rich soils (high nutrient availability) the biomass of large ungulates is about 20 times as great as on poor soils with low nutrient availability. The model based on rainfall and soil nutrient classes accounts for 87\% of the variance in large ungulate biomass. Pastoral and natural ecosystems do not differ significantly in large ungulate biomass; there is therefore currently no evidence that extensive pastoral management increases carrying capacity for large ungulates above the levels observed in natural communities. Species richness, a measure of biodiversity, had a significant but very small effect on the biomass-rainfall relation in the complete data set. When analysed by pastoral management, the effect of this factor was significant for the set of natural ecosystems only. Pastoral management and species richness may therefore have compensatory effects. These results suggest that the carrying capacity is limited at the community, rather than the species, level.},

  abstract = {In tallgrass prairie, belowground processes are even more important than in forested systems because aboveground biomass and standing dead litter are periodically removed by frequent fires or grazers. Thus, studies that address factors regulating belowground processes are especially relevant for tallgrass prairie. We predicted that effects of grazing and burning differ belowground and that changes in root productivity caused by burning or grazing provide feedback that affects ecosystem fluxes of C and N. These differences in belowground response should be driven largely by changes in N dynamics and the degree to which burning and grazing affect the pathway and magnitude of N loss and the degree of N limitation in these systems. Fire. the major pathway of N loss in ungrazed tallgrass prairie, should result in reduced net N mineralization and N availability. We expected plants to compensate for increased N limitation by increasing their allocation to roots, as manifested in increased soil respiration and C cycling belowground. In contrast, grazing conserves N in the ecosystem by redistributing the N once contained in grass to labile forms in urine and dung. Thus, we predicted that grazing should increase N cycling rates and N availability to plants. Consequently, grazed plants should be less N limited and should allocate less C to roots and more to shoots. This, in turn, should decrease belowground C cycling, manifested as reduced soil CO2 flux. We explored the roles of grazing and burning on root growth in experimental watersheds at Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA. To assess effects of fire on root productivity, we installed root ingrowth cores in two watersheds without grazers that differ in fire frequency: annually vs. infrequently burned (four years since the last fire). To assess effects of grazing, we installed root ingrowth cores in an annually burned watershed grazed by bison and in fenced controls (exclosures). Within bison "grazing lawns," root ingrowth cores were installed in lightly and heavily grazed patches. Concurrently, we measured in situ rates of net N mineralization and soil respiration as indices of soil N and C cycling. Annual burning resulted in a 25\% increase in root growth compared to the unburned watershed (four years since last fire), as plants compensated for N limitation by increasing allocation to roots. Grazing had the opposite effect: it decreased root growth, especially in heavily grazed patches (similar to 30\% less than in fenced controls). Grazing by ungulates increased N cycling and availability. Therefore, grazed plants, instead of being N limited, experienced C limitation as shoots regrew and plants allocated less C to roots. Interestingly, root ingrowth on the long-term unburned watershed was as low as in lightly grazed patches in the grazed watershed. Thus, seemingly disparate treatments such as infrequent burning (characterized by accumulation of detritus aboveground) and grazing (periodic biomass removal) both had higher levels of N availability than annually burned prairie in the absence of grazers. Root growth in unburned and grazed watersheds must be limited by resources other than N (e.g., C in grazing lawns or light in infrequently burned prairie). Burning and grazing also altered root tissue chemistry in contrasting ways that further accentuated the root growth differences caused by these treatments. Frequent fires lowered substrate quality of roots (C:N = 60), thus increasing N limitation. In contrast, grazing and infrequent burning improved root tissue quality (C:N = 40), promoting faster cycling of N. These large differences in root growth and tissue chemistry can result in profound ecosystem-level changes. Grazing increased net N mineralization rates from 87\% to 617\% compared to watersheds without grazers, whereas annual burning decreased it by similar to 50\% compared to unburned prairie. Although grazing speeded up N cycling, it reduced soil respiration by 50\% compared to fenced controls, presumably because of reduced root mass. On the other hand, annual burning increased soil respiration, presumably because of increased root biomass. Ultimately, differences in the quantity and quality of roots provide feedback to affect C and N cycling and help to maintain and even promote the fundamental differences in N cycling between burning and grazing in tallgrass prairie.},

  abstract = {In many areas of western North America, populations of elk are believed to harm production of cattle by competing with them for limited supplies of native forage. We examined effects of variation in the population density of elk (Cen,ns elaphus canadensis) during winter on growth and reproduction of cattle during spring, using a randomized complete block experiment conducted in sagebrush grassland during four years. We manipulated elk numbers to achieve four levels of population density (0, 9, 15, and 31 elk/km(2)), replicated each level three times, and observed responses of cattle to these manipulations. Mean birth dates of calves born to cows in the intermediate (9, 15 elk/km(2)) treatment levels were delayed by 5 d relative to birth dates of calves born to cows in controls (0 elk/km(2)), but these trends were not statistically significant (quadratic effect F-1,F-6 = 3.2, P = 0.13). Calf body mass at birth was not significantly influenced by treatment, but calf body mass at the end of spring declined linearly (F-1,F-6 = 7.9, P = 0.03) with increasing elk population density, from a mean of 80.2 kg in the control to 73.0 kg in the 31 elk/km(2) treatment. Calf body mass at weaning was weakly depressed by treatment, with the largest treatment effects occurring at the 9 elk/km(2) level (F-1,F-6 = 8.8, P = 0.02). Body mass of cows at the end of the spring grazing season tended to decline linearly with treatment, but these tendencies were not statistically significant (linear contrast F-1,F-6 = 1.9, P = 0.22). We did not find significant effects of treatment on cow body mass at time of weaning (control vs, others contrast F-1,F-6 = 3.3, P = 0.12) or on natality rates (control vs. other contrast F-1,F-6 = 1.2, P = 0.31), although, in both cases, values for the control tended to exceed the treatments. Body mass of cows (t(1) = -3.9, P = 0.0003) and calves (t(1) = -3.9, P $\backslash$textless 0.0001) at the end of the spring grazing season were quadratically related to the biomass of available herbaceous forage during spring. We observed a threshold in effects of forage supply on cattle production at about 45 g/m(2) of live and dead herbaceous biomass. Cattle production declined with declining forage biomass when forage supply fell below this threshold. Total cattle production (kilograms per cow per year), was quadratically related to elk population density (F-1,F-6 = 5.8, P = 0.05), Average cattle production in the control ((X) over bar = 248 kg . cow(-1). yr(-1)) exceeded the mean of the other treatment levels ((X) over bar = 224 kg . cow(-1). yr(-)1, F-1,F-6 = 6.7, P = 0.04). Quadratic responses in cattle performance were apparently caused by compensatory growth after the spring grazing season: growth rates of cows during spring were inversely related to their subsequent growth rates during summer and fall (F,,, = 33.5, P $\backslash$textless 0.0001, r(2) = 0.50). We conclude that elk grazing caused reductions in cattle production, but the magnitude of the effects were not proportionate to elk population density. Our studies revealed that competition between cattle and elk operates in a threshold fashion. If sufficient forage is available to cattle following elk grazing, elk populations will not harm cattle performance, In the system we studied, this threshold occurred at approximate to 45 g/m(2) of live and dead herbaceous biomass.},

  abstract = {We studied how ungulates and a large variation in site conditions influenced grassland nitrogen (N) dynamics in Yellowstone National Park. In contrast to most grassland N studies that have examined one or two soil N processes, we investigated four rates, net N mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, and inorganic N leaching, at seven paired sites inside and outside long-term (33+ year) exclosures. Our focus was how N fluxes were related to one another among highly variable grasslands and how grazers influenced those relationships. In addition, we examined variation in soil $\delta$15N among grasslands and the relationships between soil 15N abundance and N processes. Previously, ungulates were reported to facilitate net N mineralization across variable Yellowstone grasslands and denitrification at mesic sites. In this study, we found that herbivores also promoted nitrification among diverse grasslands. Furthermore, net N mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification (kg N ha\textendash{}1 year\textendash{}1, each variable) were postively and linearly related to one another among all grasslands (grazed and fenced), and grazers reduced the nitrification/net N mineralization and denitrification/net N mineralization ratios, indicating that ungulates inhibited the proportion of available NH4 + that was nitrified and denitrified. There was no relationship between net N mineralization or nitrification with leaching (indexed by inorganic N adsorbed to resin buried at the bottom of rooting zones) and leaching was unaffected by grazers. Soil $\delta$15N was positively and linearly related to in situ net N mineralization and nitrification in ungrazed grasslands; however, there was no relationship between isotopic composition of N and those rates among grazed grasslands. The results suggested that grazers simultaneously increased N availability (stimulated net N mineralization and nitrification per unit area) and N conservation (reduced N loss from the soil per unit net N mineralization) in Yellowstone grasslands. Grazers promoted N retention by stimulating microbial productivity, probably caused by herbivores promoting labile soil C. Process-level evidence for N retention by grazers was supported by soil $\delta$15N data. Grazed grassland with high rates of N cycling had substantially lower soil $\delta$15N relative to values expected for ungrazed grassland with comparable net N mineralization and nitrification rates. These soil 15N results suggest that ungulates inhibited N loss at those sites. Such documented evidence for consumer control of N availability to plants, microbial productivity, and N retention in Yellowstone Park is further testimony for the widespread regulation of grassland processes by large herbivores.},

We examined N cycling on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park, home for large herds of free-roaming elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison). Plant and soil N, net N mineralization, and the deposition of ungulate fecal-N were measured at five sites, a ridgetop, mid-slope bench, steep slope, valley-bottom bench, and riparian area, within a watershed from May, 1991 to April, 1992. Results indicated similarities between biogeochemical properties of Yellowstone grassland and other grassland ecosystems: (1) landscape position and soil water affected nutrient dynamics, (2) annual mineralization was positively related to soil N content, and (3) the proportion of soil N mineralized during the year was negatively related to soil C/N. Grazers were a particularly important component of the N budget of this grassland. Estimated rates of N flow from ungulates to the soil ranged from 8.1 to 45.6 kg/ha/yr at the sites (average = 27.0 kg/ha/yr), approximately 4.5 times the amount of N in senescent plants. Rates of nitrogen mineralization for Yellowstone northern range grassland were higher than those measured in other temperature grassland ecosystems, possibly due to grazers promoting N cycling in Yellowstone.},

  abstract = {Precipitation pulses in arid ecosystems can lead to temporal asynchrony in microbial and plant processing of nitrogen (N) during drying/wetting cycles causing increased N loss. In contrast, more consistent availability of soil moisture in mesic ecosystems can synchronize microbial and plant processes during the growing season, thus minimizing N loss. We tested whether microbial N cycling is asynchronous with plant N uptake in a semiarid grassland. Using (15)N tracers, we compared rates of N cycling by microbes and N uptake by plants after water pulses of 1 and 2 cm to rates in control plots without a water pulse. Microbial N immobilization, gross N mineralization, and nitrification dramatically increased 1-3 days after the water pulses, with greatest responses after the 2-cm pulse. In contrast, plant N uptake increased more after the 1-cm than after the 2-cm pulse. Both microbial and plant responses reverted to control levels within 10 days, indicating that both microbial and plant responses were short lived. Thus, microbial and plant processes were temporally synchronous following a water pulse in this semiarid grassland, but the magnitude of the pulse substantially influenced whether plants or microbes were more effective in acquiring N. Furthermore, N loss increased after both small and large water pulses (as shown by a decrease in total (15)N recovery), indicating that changes in precipitation event sizes with future climate change could exacerbate N losses from semiarid ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Although the destruction of tropical rain forests receives much attention, tropical dry forests are in general far more threatened and endangered. Eliminating grazing ungulates is often considered a key first step toward protecting these ecosystems, but few studies have investigated the long-term effects of this tech- nique. We examined the effects of ungulate exclusion from a 2.3-ha native dry-forest preserve on the island of Hawaii by comparing its present flora to the flora of an adjacent area subjected to continuous grazing since the preserve was fenced over 40 years ago. Relative to this adjacent area, the fenced preserve contained a more diverse flora with substantially greater coverage of native overstory and understory species. Until re- cently, however, regeneration of native canopy trees within the preserve appears to have been thwarted by a dominant herbaceous cover of alien fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum) and predation by alien rodent species. Our results indicate that although ungulate exclusion may be a necessary and criticalfirst step, it is not sufficient to adequately preserve and maintain Hawaii's remaining tropical dry forest remnants. Our re- cent efforts to control the dominant alien species within the fenced preserve suggest that this practice may fa- cilitate both the regeneration of native species and the colonization and potential invasion of new alien plants. Comparisons of seedlings of the dominant native canopy tree Diospyros sandwicensis growing in sites both dominated by and free of fountain grass suggested that fountain grass inhibits Diospyros seedling growth and photosynthesis but may increase survival if seedlings are protected from ungulates.},

One major conclusion is that the population dynamics of ungulates in predator-free environments is strongly influenced by a combination of stochastic variation in the environment, and population density. Both density dependence and environmental stochasticity operate through changes. In life history traits, correlated with variation in body weight. This generates delays in the response of the population to changes in environment. In the absence of predation, a stable equilibrium is therefore unlikely to exist between an ungulate population and its food resources. This thorough understanding of the mechanisms generating population fluctuations suggests that studies of ungulates will provide an important source for examining effects of long-term changes in the environment, for instance, resulting from a climatic change.},

As we start unravelling the full extent of emerging infectious diseases, there is an urgent need to facilitate multidisciplinary research in this area. Even though research in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component, cultural and technical hurdles often hamper direct collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists. Building upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research and teaching in this area, we propose practical guidelines to help with effective integration among mathematical modelling, fieldwork and laboratory work. Modelling tools can be used at all steps of a field-based research programme, from the formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and data analysis. We illustrate our model-guided fieldwork framework with two case studies we have been conducting on wildlife infectious diseases: plague transmission in prairie dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in American and African bats. These demonstrate that mechanistic models, if properly integrated in research programmes, can provide a framework for holistic approaches to complex biological systems.},

Here, we trace and review the development of AM, the central roles of consultation, collaboration and of monitoring, and of quantitative models and simulations. We identify a series of formalized, structured steps included in one AM cycle and review how current AM programs build upon such cycles. We conclude that the best AM outcomes require rigorous and formalized approaches to planning, collaboration, modelling and evaluation. Finally, simulating potential outcomes of an AM cycle in the presence of existing uncertainty can help to identify management strategies that are most likely to succeed in relation to clearly articulated goals.},

  abstract = {A reliable antemortem test is needed to understand the ecology of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni). We measured the ability of antemortem biopsy samples from the rectal mucosa to detect the abnormal prion protein associated with CWD (PrP(CWD)), the relationship between test results from the obex and rectal biopsies at varying stages of CWD progression, and the prevalence of CWD in free-ranging elk from Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA. We sampled and placed radio collars on 136 adult female elk in the winter of 2007-08. Elk with biopsy samples found positive for PrP(CWD) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were euthanized and the obex and retropharyngeal lymph nodes were examined with IHC. We resampled, euthanized, and necropsied 20, 25, and 34 of the remaining study elk in each of the three following winters, respectively. Sensitivity of rectal biopsy samples increased in an asymptotic fashion with follicle count and was maximized at 85\% (95\% credible limits [CL]=60, 98) in the beginning of the study, when a greater proportion of elk were in a detectable stage of prion infection. However, maximum sensitivity was reduced to 72\% (CL=46, 94) when we included resampled elk, which included recently infected elk that were initially negative using rectal biopsies and IHC. Test results were similar between rectal biopsies and the obex, but the earliest stages of prion infection were only detected by using retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Minimum CWD prevalence was estimated to be 9.9\% (CL=5.7, 15.7) using rectal biopsies, but this rose to 12.9\% (CL=8.0, 19.1) when we included four elk that were likely misdiagnosed at initial capture. Our results indicate rectal biopsies can provide a useful research tool for CWD in elk populations, but should be used with caution because they can miss individuals in early stages of infection and underestimate prevalence. Prevalence estimates from this population are the highest reported to date in elk and indicate that under appropriate conditions, CWD may be able to affect the dynamics of high-density elk populations.},

Nitrogen-based estimates were similar to energy-based predictions: 1,674\~n270 elk (Year 1) and 994\~n101 (Year 2). Individual habitat types differed in carrying capacity. Willow (Salix spp.), wet meadow, and wet shrub meadow could support the most elk; aspen (Populus sp.) and mesic meadow were intermediate in carrying capacity; and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), grassland, and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-shrub could carry the fewest animals. Sensitivity analysis showed predictions of the range supply-animal demand model of nutritional carrying capacity to be strongly influenced by small changes in elk metabolic fecal nitrogen excretion rates. We conclude that the temporal variation in carrying capacity is important in managing harvest of elk populations and in planning future carrying-capacity research, and that estimates of nutritional carrying capacity are viable habitat evaluation procedures, particularly when used for comparative purposes.},

Populations possess structure, which may be defined as "fixed" stages through which individuals pass, with superimposed variability among individuals and groups. Data contain missing values and inaccurate censuses. From limited data ecologists attempt to predict life history schedules and population growth. We extend the "missing value" framework for Bayesian analysis of structured populations to admit the heterogeneity in demography and the limitations of data that are typical of ecological populations. Our hierarchical treatment of capture-recapture data allows inference on demographic rates contained in matrix transition models for populations that may be stratified by location and by other variables. Simulations with artificial data sets demonstrate the ability of the Bayesian model to Successfully estimate underlying parameters, even with incomplete census data. In contrast, traditional nonhierarchical models may lead to biased parameter estimates because of variation in recapture rates of individuals. Analyses of published demographic data on Common Terns and Taitu Hills rats illustrate the utility of the model. Predictive distributions of maturation age, survivorship, and population growth demonstrate profound impacts of population and data complexity.},

  volume = {71},
  abstract = {The realized impact of a vital rate on population growth (k) is determined by both the relative influence of the vital rate on k (elasticity) and its magnitude of variability. We estimated mean survival and reproductive rates in elk (Cervus elaphus) and spatial and temporal variation in these rates from 37 sources located primarily across the Rocky Mountain region and northwestern United States. We removed sampling variance from estimates of process variance both within and across vital-rate data sets using the variance discounting method developed by White (2000). Deterministic elasticities calculated from a population matrix model parameterized with these mean vital rates ranked adult female survival (e\_Scow=0.869) much higher than calf survival (e\_Scalf=0.131). However, process variance in calf survival (sigma\_Scalf =0.039) was .11 times greater than process variance in female survival (sigma\_Scow 1$\fracslash$4 0.003) across data sets and 10 times greater on average (sigma\_Scalf=0.020; r2Scow=0.002) within studies. We conducted Life-Stage Simulation Analysis to incorporate both vital-rate elasticity patterns and empirical estimates of variability to identify those vital rates most influential in elk population dynamics. The overwhelming magnitude of variation in calf survival explained 75\% of the variation in the population growth rates generated from 1,000 matrix replicates, compared to just 16\% of the variation in k explained by variation in female survival. Variation in calf survival greatly impacts elk population growth and calls into question the utility of classical elasticity analysis alone for guiding elk management. These results also suggest that the majority of interannual variability that wildlife managers document in late-winter and spring elk surveys is attributable to variation in calf survival over the previous year and less influenced by variation in the harvest of females during the preceding autumn. To meet elk population size objectives, managers should consider the inherent variation in calf survival, and its apparent sensitivity to management, in addition to female harvest.},

  title = {Uncertainty and Variability in Demography and Population Growth: A Hierarchical Approach},
  volume = {84},
  abstract = {Estimates of uncertainty are the basis for inference of population risk. Un- certainty is estimated from models fitted to data that typically include a deterministic model (e.g., population growth) and stochastic elements, which should accommodate errors in sampling and any sources of variability that affect observations. Prediction from fitted models (of, say, demography) to new variables (say, population growth) requires propa- gation of these stochastic elements. Ecological models ignore most forms of variability, because they make statistical models complex, and they pose computational challenges. Variability associated with space, time, and among individuals that is not accommodated by demographic models can make parameter estimates and growth rate predictions unre- alistic. I adapt a hierarchical approach to the problem of estimating population growth rates and their uncertainties when individuals vary and that variability cannot be assigned to specific causes. In contrast to an overfitted model that would assign a different parameter value to each individual, hierarchical models accommodate individual differences, but as- sume that those differences derive from an underlying distribution\textemdash{}they belong to a ``pop- ulation.'' The hierarchical model can be implemented in classical (frequentist) and Bayesian frameworks (I demonstrate both) and analyzed using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Results show that population growth models that rely on standard propagation of estimation error but ignore variability among individuals can misrepresent uncertainties in ways that erode credibility},

  volume = {66},
  abstract = {We studied population subdivision and density-dependent and independent factors influencing population processes between 1965 and 2001 for elk (Cervus elaphus) inhabiting Rocky Mountain National Park (park) and the adjacent Estes Valley (town), Colorado, USA. Elk numbers within the park were field relatively constant by management controls until 1967, after which time they were allowed to increase Without human interference. Radiotelemetry of 73 elk indicated limited exchange between the subpopulations; combined with clear distinctions in population dynamics, this suggests that these subpopulations are relatively independent despite the absence of physical barriers between them. The elk subpopulation within the park initially increased at 6.5\%/year between 1968 and 1970, then growth gradually slowed-exhibiting density-dependent reductions both in calf survival and recruitment with increasing population size-and approached an estimated carrying capacity of 1,069 55 (x SE). Since 1991, this subpopulation has remained within +/-5\% of this equilibrium. The adjacent Estes Valley subpopulation grew at an estimated maximum 5-year average rate of 11.0\% from 1979 to 1983 and is still increasing at 5.2\%/year (1991-2001 average). Estimated town population currently is about 70\% of our projected carrying capacity of 2,869 +/- 415 elk based on projection of observed calf recruitment decline with increasing population. Both carrying-capacity estimates are consistent with independent estimates based on forage biomass and energy considerations. Adult cow survival rate was not found to differ between park and town, and we estimated a constant rate of 0.913 [95\% CI - 0.911, 0.915]. Bull survival rates increased in the park from 0.52 to 0.79 between 1965 and 2001, but remained constant at 0.42 [0.35, 0.47] in the Estes Valley. Colder winter temperatures were correlated with reduced calf recruitment (calves:cow at age 0.5 yr) and with reduced calf survival (between age 0.5 and 1.5 yr) in town. Recruitment of town elk also increased with warmer summer temperatures and greater summer precipitation. No weather covariates were significantly correlated with calf recruitment or survival in the park. Declining calf recruitment has been nearly linear and similar in both the park and town. In the park, calf survival responded little to density when the Population was well below carrying capacity, but responded at an increasing rate as the population neared carrying capacity. This pattern may explain why calf survival response to density has not yet been detected in town. We estimated. current combined population size of 3,049 [2759, 3369] elk in 2001. Elk in the town sector currently Outnumber elk in the adjacent national park by almost 2:1 and are projected to increase by 46\% before being nutritionally limited, suggesting that human-elk conflicts likely will increase in the absence of active management intervention.},

These models may be suitable for analysing locational data obtained by such sampling methods as radio tracking or live trapping. The most useful methods for analysing home range data sets involve describing an animal's range by a probability density function of location, called the utilization distribution. Robust methods of estimation of the utilization distribution are related to the estimation of the probability function, Of this type of approach, the method of Ford and Krumme is criticised. The Harmonic Mean method of Dixon and Chapman is shown to be an improper form of the statistical method of kernel estimation. A comparison of the properties of all the models for home range considered here shows that both the Fourier Transform method proposed by D.J. Anderson and the kernel method are good because of their flexibility. The assumption of independence of locational observations which is often made is discussed and shown to be important, especially for data collected by radio tracking. Some limitations of home range studies are considered.},

  abstract = {Home ranges of animals are associated with the spatial distribution of limiting resources on a landscape, yet no mechanistic models representing this relationship exist. We present models of how animals might choose patches for their home ranges in ways that are optimal with respect to spatially distributed resources. The models assume that animals choose patches for their home ranges based on resource benefits discounted for travel costs. Animals might select patches to maximize resources within their home ranges over random use of the landscape (resource maximization), or to satisfy a minimum resource threshold needed for survival or reproduction (area minimization). We evaluated how landscape configuration structures home ranges of animals by performing individual-based, spatially explicit computer simulations using each model on simulated landscapes that differed only in the spatial continuity of resources among patches (from over-dispersed to clumped). The most important factor determining quality, efficiency, resource content, and spatial distribution of home ranges was the extent to which resources were clumped on a landscape. Characteristics of resource-maximizing home ranges were determined only by the distribution of resources, and differed from those of area-minimizing home ranges depending upon the magnitude of the resource threshold required. An increase in resource threshold increased area and total resource content for area-minimizing home ranges, but did not change their quality or efficiency. Because animals can consume or protect resources within their home ranges, they can depress the value of resources available to other animals and hence how those animals will choose their home ranges. Depression of resource values on a landscape by animals should result in different configuration and spatial distribution of home ranges on a landscape than would be predicted in its absence. We modified the two home range models to depress the value of resources available to other animals within patches selected for each home range. We generated home ranges with the new models on the simulated landscapes and evaluated how home ranges with resource depression varied with landscape configuration and with the number of home ranges on the landscape. We compared characteristics and spatial distribution of home ranges with resource depression to those of home ranges that do not. For the number of simulations we performed, resource depression resulted in home ranges that differed little in configuration and landscape interactions from those without, except that they were distributed more evenly on the landscapes and overlapped each other less. As the number of home ranges on a landscape increased, resource distributions declined in quality and heterogeneity, and home ranges became larger, less efficient, and of lower quality. Our results suggest that, in addition to landscape configuration, the extent to which animals depress resources included in their home ranges should determine the evenness of spatial dispersion, overlap, and home range structure, especially where animals select home ranges to satisfy a specific resource threshold and the density of animals is high. Because resource depression sets a limit on the number of home ranges a landscape with fixed resource levels can support, our models provide a means of assessing carrying capacity of a landscape. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In these two long-term monitoring studies, one in Bogesund, Sweden (12 years) and one in Dourdan, France (10 years), deer density varied fourfold through varying culling pressure. Home-range data were collected by radio-tracking across the periods of contrasting density of the studies. We predicted that home-range size for females should vary in relation to the level of feeding competition, while for males, competition for mating opportunities should also influence range size, at least in summer when roe bucks are territorial. We found a highly consistent pattern over the two populations, with strong effects of deer density on home-range size, as well as significant differences between winter and summer ranges and between the sexes. Home ranges were consistently smaller at high density compared to low density. Males had larger ranges than females and this was particularly so during summer. Lastly, winter ranges were generally larger than summer ranges, particularly among females, although males at Dourdan had larger summer ranges compared to winter ranges. We suggest that the reduction of range size at high deer density during winter, as well as summer, is linked to the solitary behaviour and territorial social system of roe deer, with possible effects of dominance rank, even outside the mating season.},

  doi = {10.1038/nature06199},
  abstract = {The study of animal foraging behaviour is of practical ecological importance, and exemplifies the wider scientific problem of optimizing search strategies. L\'evy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails, such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. L\'evy flights display fractal properties, have no typical scale, and occur in physical and chemical systems. An attempt to demonstrate their existence in a natural biological system presented evidence that wandering albatrosses perform L\'evy flights when searching for prey on the ocean surface. This well known finding was followed by similar inferences about the search strategies of deer and bumblebees. These pioneering studies have triggered much theoretical work in physics (for example, refs 11, 12), as well as empirical ecological analyses regarding reindeer, microzooplankton, grey seals, spider monkeys and fishing boats. Here we analyse a new, high-resolution data set of wandering albatross flights, and find no evidence for L\'evy flight behaviour. Instead we find that flight times are gamma distributed, with an exponential decay for the longest flights. We re-analyse the original albatross data using additional information, and conclude that the extremely long flights, essential for demonstrating L\'evy flight behaviour, were spurious. Furthermore, we propose a widely applicable method to test for power-law distributions using likelihood and Akaike weights. We apply this to the four original deer and bumblebee data sets, finding that none exhibits evidence of L\'evy flights, and that the original graphical approach is insufficient. Such a graphical approach has been adopted to conclude L\'evy flight movement for other organisms, and to propose L\'evy flight analysis as a potential real-time ecosystem monitoring tool. Our results question the strength of the empirical evidence for biological L\'evy flights.},

The theoretical tool used is the Fokker-Planck equation, its characteristic quantities being the diffusion constant which describes the motion of the animals, and the attractive potential which addresses their tendency to live in restricted regions, e.g., near their burrows. The measurement technique is shown to correspond to the calculation of a certain kind of mean square displacement of the animals relevant to the specific probing window in space corresponding to the region of observation. The output of the theory is a sigmoid curve of the observable mean square displacement as a function of the ratio of distances characteristic of the home range and the measurement window, along with an explicit prescription to extract the home range from observations. Applications of the theory to rodent movement in Panama and New Mexico are pointed out. An analysis is given of the sensitivity of our theory to the choice of the confining potential via the use of various representative cases.

  abstract = {1. Although the home range is a fundamental ecological concept, there is considerable debate over how it is best measured. There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences. 2. We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime. 3. To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods. 4. Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized number of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95\% isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50\%. 5. Using the same number of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the number of days sampled, even if using KDE methods. 6. The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes. 7. We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis.},

We applied the approach to data from a roe deer population radiotracked in central Italy. Over multiple timescales, temporal variation is explained by photoperiod and climate and spatial variation by the distribution of habitat types and spatial variance in radiotracking error. Differences between individuals explained a substantial amount of variance in home range size, but only a relatively minor part was explained by the individual attributes of sex and age. We conclude that the choice of temporal scale at which data are collected and the definition of home range can significantly influence biological inference. We suggest that the appropriate choice of scale and definition requires a good understanding of the ecology and life history of the study species.

Samples were collected in 1998 and in 2010. 3. Soil carbon (C) concentration was 25\% lower in grazed areas than in exclosures; soil nitrogen (N) concentration was 23\% lower. From 1998 to 2010, the mean percentage change for soil C and N concentrations was + 14\% and + 27\%, respectively, in exclosures and -22\% and -24\%, respectively, in grazed sites. 4. Soil bulk density in grazed areas was 25\% greater than in ungrazed areas; soil moisture in grazed areas was 15\% lower than in ungrazed areas. 5. Physical soil attributes, soil nutrient stocks and soil microbial biomass were significantly correlated, exhibiting linkages that can accelerate changes in ecosystem function. Plant N concentrations suggest soil nutrient losses were not related to substitutions for N-rich forage species. 6. Synthesis and applications. Intensive grazing was correlated with drier more compacted soils and nutrient loss, suggesting increasing N limitation and reduced plant biodiversity. Recovery of soil nutrients and soil structure appears possible in the studied montane riparian zone if vegetation receives grazing protection. Cervus elaphus density and distribution should be controlled in the short term to restore soil structure, hydraulic conductivity and nutrients. Active management could be obviated in the longer term through restoration of predators and ecosystem engineers.},

  abstract = {Accurately estimating abundance of wildlife is critical for establishing effective conservation and management strategies. Aerial methodologies for estimating abundance are common in developed countries, but they are often impractical for remote areas of developing countries where many of the world's endangered and threatened fauna exist. The alternative terrestrial methodologies can be constrained by limitations on access, technology, and human resources, and have rarely been comprehensively conducted for large terrestrial mammals at landscape scales. We attempted to overcome these problems by incorporating local peoples into a simultaneous point count of Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) across the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area, Mongolia. Paired observers collected abundance and covariate metrics at 50 observation points and we estimated population sizes using distance sampling theory, but also assessed individual observer error to examine potential bias introduced by the large number of minimally trained observers. We estimated 5671 (95\% CI=3611-8907) wild asses and 5909 (95\% CI=3762-9279) gazelle inhabited the 11,027km 2 study area at the time of our survey and found that the methodology developed was robust at absorbing the logistical challenges and wide range of observer abilities. This initiative serves as a functional model for estimating terrestrial wildlife abundance while integrating local people into scientific and conservation projects. This, in turn, creates vested interest in conservation by the people who are most influential in, and most affected by, the outcomes. ?? 2012.},

We used paired grazed and ungrazed plots to evaluate ungulate herbivory effects in short and tall willow (Salix spp.), aspen (Populus spp.), and upland grass/shrub vegetation associations. We measured nitrogen (N) fluxes (litter deposition, fecal and urinary deposition from elk, movements of N by elk, N mineralization, soil N availability, elk consumption rates) within the elk winter, above-ground and below-ground N pools (herbaceous, shrub and root biomass, \%N in plants, roots, and soil), and N fluxes on and off the elk winter range (seasonal movement of N by elk). Nitrogen mineralization and soil nitrate (NO3) pools were reduced in the short willow community (P = 0.07 and 0.10, respectively; n = 4 sites) in grazed plots, but not in the upland grass/shrub community or tall willow sites (P$\backslash$textgreater 0.10). Annual growth of willows was reduced by 98\% in grazed plots, relative to 35-year exclosures, and 66\% relative to 4-year exclosures. Thus, height, canopy size, and litter biomass of willows were reduced, and N yield of willows was 64\% less in grazed plots. We evaluated movement of N by elk among 6 major vegetation associations and found that elk grazed more and bedded less in willow vegetation association compared to mixed conifer, mesic meadow, and grassland/shrub associations (P = 0.014, 0.001, and 0.026, respectively), suggesting that elk herbivory and movement led to a net loss of N in the willow vegetation association. Elk spent less total time in willows than mesic meadow association, yet they consumed large amounts of willow plant biomass. We recommend management of elk numbers and elk herbivory that takes into consideration impacts to N process function, as negative effects from current levels of herbivory were observed in $\backslash$textgreater1 of 3 vegetation associations studied.},

  abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) represent the single, unified analysis of population count data and demographic data. This modelling framework is quite novel and can be implemented within the classical or the Bayesian mode of statistical inference. Here, we briefly show the basic steps that need to be taken when an inte- grated population model is adopted, and review existing integrated population models for birds and mammals. There are important advantages of integrated compared to conventional analyses that analyse each dataset separately and then try to make an inference about population dynamics. First, integrated population models allow the estimating of more demographic quantities, because there is information about all demographic processes operating in a population, and this information is exploited. Second, parameter estimates become more precise, and this enhances statistical power. Finally, all sources of uncer- tainty due to process variability and the sampling pro- cess(es) are adequately included. Core of the integrated models is the link of changes in the population size and the demographic rates via a demographic model (usually a Leslie matrix model) and the likelihoods of all existing datasets. We discuss some critical assumptions that are typically made in integrated population models and high- light fruitful areas of future research. Currently, we have found 25 studies that used integrated population models. Central to most studies was statistical development rather than their application to address an ecological question, which is not surprising given that integrated population models are still a new development. We predict that inte- grated population models will become a common and important tool in studies of population dynamics, both in ecology and its applications, such as conservation biology or wildlife management.},

The time an animal spends in an area of a given size is termed 'first-passage time' and can be used to identify the scales at which different movement processes occur. Using first-passage time and 2-h observations, we identified nested spatial scales representing three movement behaviours for elk (Cervus elaphus) - inactive/ resting (moves $\backslash$textless 50 m), active/foraging ($\backslash$textless(x)over bar$\backslash$textgreater = 276.7 m, SD = 56.6), and active/relocating ((x) over bar = 1628.3 m, SD = 436.6). Our ability to identify inactive behaviour was limited by GPS accuracy. The scale separating relocating and foraging behaviour. ranged 550-1650 m across individuals and varied quadratically with the mean patch size of cutover forest in an animal's home range. We classified path segments into the 3 movement behaviours and related behaviours to local. environmental conditions. Elk were likely to be inactive in areas having a low predicted use by wolves (Canis lupus), farther than 50 in from anthropogenic linear clearings, and where microclimatic conditions were cool (high shrub cover and north to east-facing slopes). In contrast, elk were most likely to forage in areas having intermediate levels of herbaceous biomass and low movement costs. Elk were most likely to be relocating when in areas of high wolf use, when close to linear clearings, and in energetically costly situations such as moving upslope. We discuss how elk use of potential foraging habitats may be restricted in this landscape by risks imposed by predators, humans, or both.},

We begin with a null model of space use to describe an animal's utilization distribution in the absence of effects from environmental covariates. We then use this null model as the foundation for a set of candidate models of space use that incorporate different combinations of environmental covariates where each model is chosen to reflect various hypotheses about important drivers of space use. Models are parameterized via maximum likelihood using location data collected from individuals at discrete times (e.g., telemetry) and spatially explicit environmental covariates. Information theoretic criteria are used to select the model(s) with most support from the data. The best model(s) is then used for both estimating the animal's home range and for inferring the relative importance of various environmental factors on space use. As an example, we applied our approach using male white rhino (Ceratotherium simum) location data collected in Matobo National Park, Zimbabwe. The best synoptic model was able to capture the complexities of the utilization distribution while the model structure and parameter estimates provided a basis to infer the importance of various ecological factors affecting male rhino space use. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Heterogeneous usage of space by individual animals or animal populations is partly due to their preference for particular resources that are, themselves, heterogeneously distributed. When all points in the environment are equally accessible, a direct relationship between usage and preference can be assumed. However, when accessibility is restricted, spatial variations in usage can no longer be attributed entirely to preference. In such cases, it is necessary to control for the effects of accessibility on observed usage before conclusions about preference can be drawn. In this paper, I develop a modelling framework that treats the use of space by animals as a joint function of preference and accessibility. I specify a null version of the framework that assumes no preference and propose that its output can be used to control for the effect of accessibility on the observed, spatial distribution of usage. I briefly discuss how the framework can subsequently be used to provide insights about the animals' preference for different resources and types of movement, and to predict usage in areas where no usage data exist. I explore the properties of the methodology using data from a population of simulated animals and present the first results of its application to a sub-set of the British population of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

An analysis of simulated data using several models constructed within the proposed framework is also presented to illustrate the possible gains from the flexible modeling framework.

Analyses based on utilization distributions (UDs) have been ubiquitous in animal space use studies, largely because they are computationally straightforward and relatively easy to employ. Conventional applications of resource utilization functions (RUFs) suggest that estimates of UDs can be used as response variables in a regression involving spatial covariates of interest. 2. It has been claimed that contemporary implementations of RUFs can yield inference about resource selection, although to our knowledge, an explicit connection has not been described. 3. We explore the relationships between RUFs and resource selection functions from a hueristic and simulation perspective. We investigate several sources of potential bias in the estimation of resource selection coefficients using RUFs (e.g. the spatial covariance modelling that is often used in RUF analyses). 4. Our findings illustrate that RUFs can, in fact, serve as approximations to RSFs and are capable of providing inference about resource selection, but only with some modification and under specific circumstances. 5. Using real telemetry data as an example, we provide guidance on which methods for estimating resource selection may be more appropriate and in which situations. In general, if telemetry data are assumed to arise as a point process, then RSF methods may be preferable to RUFs; however, modified RUFs may provide less biased parameter estimates when the data are subject to location error.},

  abstract = {Understanding habitat selection is of primary interest in theoretical and ap- plied ecology. One approach is to infer habitat selection processes from differences in population densities between habitats using methods such as isodar and isoleg analysis. Another approach is to directly observe the movements of individuals. However, habitat selection models based on movement data often fail to adequately incorporate spatial pro- cesses. This is problematic if the probability of selecting a particular habitat is dependent upon its spatial context. This would occur, for example, where organisms exhibit home range behavior and the choice of habitat is dependent on its location relative to the home range. In this paper we present a spatially explicit habitat selection model for movement data that incorporates home range behavior as a spatial process. Our approach extends a previous model by formulating the probability of selecting a habitat as a function of its distance from the animal's current location and home range center. We demonstrate that these enhancements lead to more parsimonious models when applied to a koala radio- tracking data set from eastern Australia. This approach could also be applied to modeling other spatial habitat selection processes, leading to more biologically meaningful models for a range of species and applications.},

  abstract = {Home ranges of animals are generally structured by the selective use of resource-bearing patches that comprise habitat. Based on this concept, home ranges of animals estimated from location data are commonly used to infer habitat relationships. Because home ranges estimated from animal locations are largely continuous in space, the resource-bearing patches selected by an animal from a fragmented distribution of patches would be difficult to discern; unselected patches included in the home range estimate would bias an understanding of important habitat relationships. To evaluate potential for this bias, we generated simulated home ranges based on optimal selection of resource-bearing patches across a series of simulated resource distributions that varied in the spatial continuity of resources. For simulated home ranges where selected patches were spatially disjunct, we included interstitial, unselected cells most likely to be traveled by an animal moving among selected patches. We compared characteristics of the simulated home ranges with and without interstitial patches to evaluate how insights derived from field estimates can differ from actual characteristics of home ranges, depending on patchiness of landscapes. Our results showed that contiguous home range estimates could lead to misleading insights on the quality, size, resource content, and efficiency of home ranges, proportional to the spatial discontinuity of resource-bearing patches. We conclude the potential bias of including unselected, largely irrelevant patches in the field estimates of home ranges of animals can be high, particularly for home range estimators that assume uniform use of space within home range boundaries. Thus, inferences about the habitat relationships that ultimately define an animal's home range can be misleading where animals occupy landscapes with patchily distributed resources.},

Here we review recent advances in modelling home range behaviour, focusing particularly on the problem of identifying mechanisms that lead to the emergence of stable home ranges from unbounded movement paths. We discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges. Recent methodological and theoretical advances may soon lead to a unified approach, however, conceptually unifying our understanding of linkages among home range behaviour and ecological or evolutionary processes.},

  doi = {10.1086/587826},
  abstract = {Machine learning methods, a family of statistical techniques with origins in the field of artificial intelligence, are recognized as holding great promise for the advancement of understanding and prediction about ecological phenomena. These modeling techniques are flexible enough to handle complex problems with multiple interacting elements and typically outcompete traditional approaches (e.g., generalized linear models), making them ideal for modeling ecological systems. Despite their inherent advantages, a review of the literature reveals only a modest use of these approaches in ecology as compared to other disciplines. One potential explanation for this lack of interest is that machine learning techniques do not fall neatly into the class of statistical modeling approaches with which most ecologists are familiar. In this paper, we provide an introduction to three machine learning approaches that can be broadly used by ecologists: classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary computation. For each approach, we provide a brief background to the methodology, give examples of its application in ecology, describe model development and implementation, discuss strengths and weaknesses, explore the availability of statistical software, and provide an illustrative example. Although the ecological application of machine learning approaches has increased, there remains considerable skepticism with respect to the role of these techniques in ecology. Our review encourages a greater understanding of machin learning approaches and promotes their future application and utilization, while also providing a basis from which ecologists can make informed decisions about whether to select or avoid these approaches in their future modeling endeavors.},

  abstract = {Spatial models for habitat selection of marsh-breeding bird species were developed using artificial neural networks. The habitat models included single and multiple species artificial neural networks for red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) and marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris). Data for the study came from two diked wetland basins on southwestern Lake Erie, USA. The single species artificial neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model except in the presence of interspecific interaction with marsh wren. A multiple species habitat model was developed using data from one basin that included both nesting red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. The multiple species neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model in the presence of interspecific interaction and could simultaneously predict the nest locations of both species. Using neural interpretation diagrams, relevances, and sensitivity analyses, we determined the mechanisms of habitat selection in red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. Habitat selection in marsh-breeding bird species was a non-linear process that could not be sufficiently understood in terms of general linear models. The non-linear structure of the neural network model not only predicts habitat selection better, but with a critical evaluation through neural interpretation diagrams, relevances and sensitivity analyses can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of habitat selection. As predictive tools single species neural network models were too specific in cases where the system changed to include interacting species. In these cases linear models might be better predictors but not necessarily provide a better understanding. In the presence of two interacting species we suggest the use of a neural network model that is trained with a data set from a wetland where all the interacting species are present. In the absence of the interacting species the dynamics will change and habitat selection can be based on an entirely different set of rules and relationships. Therefore, the decision on which neural network model to use must be based on an in-depth understanding of the ecology of the system under study.},

The special issue of this ecological modelling journal begins with the state-of-the-art with emphasis on the development of structural dynamic models presented by S.E. Jorgensen (DK). Then, to illustrate the ecological applications of ANNs, examples are drawn from several fields, e.g. terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, remote sensing and evolutionary ecology. In this paper, we present some of the most important papers of the first workshop about ANNs in ecological modelling. We briefly introduce here two algorithms frequently used; (i) one supervised network, the backpropagation algorithm; and (ii) one unsupervised network, the Kohonen self-organizing mapping algorithm. The future development of ANNs is discussed in the present work. Several examples of modelling of ANNs in various areas of ecology are presented in this special issue.},

We used radio-telemetry to monitor an entire founding population of 70 elk (Cervus elaphus) during 16 months following their reintroduction to eastern Ontario, Canada. At the end of the study, elk were widely scattered over a 27,000 km2 area. Dispersal distances ranged from 2 to 142 km; 50\% of animals moved $\backslash$textgreater 40 km from the release site. Dispersal distances differed by time periods and age but not sex. Calves dispersed significantly shorter distances than adults and many mature elk were isolated during the rut. In contrast to a random distribution model, movements had a strongly southwestern directional bias, perhaps owing to prevailing winds from the same direction. Mortality during the study period was 27\%; the primary causes of known mortalities were emaciation, collision with automobiles, and illegal shooting. During the first 11 / 2 years, lack of release-site fidelity and high dispersal coupled with animal-human conflicts and mortalities likely contributed to an initial lag in population growth. Resource managers planning animal reintroductions should consider using methodologies that enhance site fidelity following release.},

Bayesian state-spacemovementmodels have been proposed as a method of inferring behavioural states from movement paths (Morales et al. 2004), thereby providing insight into the behavioural processes fromwhich pat- terns of animal space use arise in heterogeneous environments. It is not clear, however, how effective state-space models are at estimating behavioural states. 2. Weuse stochastic simulations of twomovementmodels to quantify howbehavioural statemovement charac- teristics affect classification error. State-space movement models can be a highly effective approach to estimating behavioural states frommovement paths. 3. Classification accuracywas contingent upon the degree of separation between the distributions that character- ize the states (e.g. step length and turn angle distributions) and the relative frequency of the behavioural states. In the best case scenarios classification accuracy approached 100\%, butwas close to 0\%when step length and turn angle distributions of each state were similar, or when one state was rare. Mean classification accuracy was un- correlatedwith path length, but the variance in classification accuracy was inversely related to path length. 4. Importantly, we find that classification accuracy can be predicted based on the separation between distribu- tions that characterize the movement paths, thereby providing a method of estimating classification accuracy for real movement paths. We demonstrate this approach using radiotelemetry relocation data of 34 moose (Alces alces). 5. We conclude that Bayesian state-space models offer powerful new opportunities for inferring behavioural states from relocation data.},

Moreover, understanding the effects of extrinsic (e.g., predation risk) and intrinsic (e.g., age and sex) factors on individual differences in seasonal transition dates will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms driving animal movement and potentially population dynamics. We used nonlinear modeling of movement rate over time using global positioning system\textendash{}collared nonmigratory elk (Cervus elaphus manitobensis) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in southern Manitoba, Canada, to derive species- and sex-specific seasonal transition dates. In addition, we used variables known to influence timing of migration in migratory populations to explain individual differences in seasonal transition dates.We found ecologically important differences in start and length of seasons between male and female elk and white-tailed deer. Individual differences in seasonal transition dates were large, and could be explained by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Age-class of the individual animal and elevation influenced timing of winter, spring, and date of parturition, whereas predation risk from wolves (Canis lupus) influenced onset of spring, summer, and autumn. Our findings suggest that similar extrinsic and intrinsic factors can influence both large- (i.e., migratory) and small-scale movement patterns and can be used effectively to empirically define biologically relevant seasons for sympatric large herbivores.},

By studying the causes and consequences of individual movement, ecologists have gained greater insight into the behavior of individuals and the spatial dynamics of populations at increasingly higher levels of organization. In particular, ecologists have focused on the interaction between individuals and their environment in an effort to understand future impacts from habitat loss and climate change. Tools to examine this interaction have included: fractal analysis, first passage time, L\'evy flights, multi-behavioral analysis, hidden markov models, and state-space models. Concurrent with the development of movement models has been an increase in the sophistication and availability of hierarchical bayesian models. In this review we bring these two threads together by using hierarchical structures as a framework for reviewing individual models. We synthesize emerging themes in movement ecology, and propose a new hierarchical model for animal movement that builds on these emerging themes. This model moves away from traditional random walks, and instead focuses inference on how moving animals with complex behavior interact with their landscape and make choices about its suitability.},

Through the use of electronic tagging and tracking (ETT), collection of in situ data from free-roaming animals is now commonplace, yet statistical approaches enabling direct relation of movement observations to environmental conditions are still in development. 2. In this study, we examine the hidden Markov model (HMM) for behavioural analysis of tracking data. HMMs allow for prediction of latent behavioural states while directly accounting for the serial dependence prevalent in ETT data. Updating the probability of behavioural switches with tag or remote-sensing data provides a statistical method that links environmental data to behaviour in a direct and integrated manner. 3. It is important to assess the reliability of state categorization over the range of time-series lengths typically collected from field instruments and when movement behaviours are similar between movement states. Simulation with varying lengths of times series data and contrast between average movements within each state was used to test the HMMs ability to estimate movement parameters. 4. To demonstrate the methods in a realistic setting, the HMMs were used to categorize resident and migratory phases and the relationship between movement behaviour and ocean temperature using electronic tagging data from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii). Diagnostic tools to evaluate the suitability of different models and inferential methods for investigating differences in behaviour between individuals are also demonstrated.},

We present a model-fitting procedure to estimate model parameters from multiple sources of observed data using weighted least squares and model selection based on Akaike's Information Criterion. The procedure is relatively simple to implement with modern spreadsheet software. We illustrate such an implementation using an example mule deer population. Typical data required include age and sex ratios, antlered and antlerless harvest, and population size. Estimates of young and adult survival are highly desirable. Although annual estimates are desirable, the procedure also can be applied-with less precision-to data sets with missing values in any of the data series. The model-fitting procedure adjusts input estimates and provides estimates of unobserved parameters to achieve the best overall fit of the model to observed data. Rigorous, objective procedures such as those described here are required as a basis for wildlife management decisions because diverse stakeholder groups are increasing the intensity with which they scrutinize such management decisions.},

Now, reflecting extensive developments in Bayesian methods for simulating posterior distributions, this Second Edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers a thoroughly up-to-date, reorganized survey of current methodology for handling missing-data problems. Blending theory and application, authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe rigorous yet simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing-data mechanism and apply the theory to a wide range of important missing-data problems. The new edition now enlarges its coverage to include: Expanded coverage of Bayesian methodology, both theoretical and computational, and of multiple imputation Analysis of data with missing values where inferences are based on likelihoods derived from formal statistical models for the data-generating and missing-data mechanisms Applications of the approach in a variety of contexts including regression, factor analysis, contingency table analysis, time series, and sample survey inference Extensive references, examples, and exercises "Amstat News" asked three review editors to rate their top five favorite books in the September 2003 issue.

These approaches primarily used conjugate beta and Dirichlet priors. Altham (1969, 1971) presented Bayesian analogs of small-sample frequentist tests for 2\texttimes{}2 tables using such priors. An alternative approach using normal priors for logits received considerable attention in the 1970s by Leonard and others (e.g., Leonard 1972). Adopted usually in a hierarchical form, the logit-normal approach allows greater flexibility and scope for generalization. The 1970s also saw considerable interest in loglinear modeling. The advent of modern computational methods since the mid-1980s has led to a growing literature on fully Bayesian analyses with models for categorical data, with main emphasis on generalized linear models such as logistic regression for binary and multi-category response variables.},

The framework is a state-space model where the population processes are modelled by the state process and measurements are modelled by the observation process. In many cases, the expected value for the state process can be represented as a generalisation of the standard population projection matrix: each sub-process within the state process may be modelled by a separate matrix and the product of these matrices is a generalised Leslie matrix. By selecting appropriate matrices and their ordering, a wide range of models may be specified. The method is fully flexible for allowing stochastic variation in the processes. Process parameters may themselves be modelled as functions of covariates. The structure accommodates effects such as density dependence, competition and predator-prey relationships, and metapopulations are readily modelled. Observations on the population enter through an observation process model, and we show how likelihood functions can be built that reflect both demographic stochasticity (which appears in the state process) and stochastic errors in the observations. Parameter estimation and estimation of state process variables can be conducted using sequential Monte Carlo procedures. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broad- er-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation tech- niques, all under a single statistical framework.

The model may be parameterized for a robust sampling design consisting of multiple primary sampling occasions where closure need not be met between primary occasions. We applied the model to brown bear data from three study areas in Alaska and compared its performance to the joint hypergeometric estimator (JHE) and Bowden's estimator (BOWE). BBE estimates suggest heterogeneity levels were non-negligible and discourage the use of JHE for these data. Compared to JHE and BOWE, confidence intervals were considerably shorter for the AlCc model-averaged BBE. To evaluate the properties of BBE relative to JHE and BOWE when sample sizes are small, simulations were performed with data from three primary occasions generated under both individual heterogeneity and temporal variation in p. All models remained consistent regardless of levels of variation in p. In terms of precision, the AIC(c) model-averaged BBE showed advantages over JHE and BOWE when heterogeneity was present and mean sighting probabilities were similar between primary occasions. Based on the conditions examined, BBE is a reliable alternative to JHE or BOWE and provides a framework for further advances in mark-resight abundance estimation.},

  abstract = {Estimation of animal density is fundamental to ecology, and ecologists often pursue density estimates using grids of detectors (e.g., cameras, live traps, hair snags) to sample animals at a study site. However, under such a framework, reliable estimates can be difficult to obtain because animals move on and off of the site during the sampling session (i.e., the site is not closed geographically). Generally, practitioners address lack of geographic closure by inflating the area sampled by the detectors based on the mean distance individuals moved between trapping events or invoking hierarchical models in which animal density is assumed to be a spatial point process, and detection is modeled as a declining function of distance to a detector. We provide an alternative in which lack of geographic closure is sampled directly using telemetry, and this auxiliary information is used to compute estimates of density based on a modified Huggins closed-capture estimator. Contrary to other approaches, this method is free from assumptions regarding the distribution and movement of animals on the landscape, the stationarity of their home ranges, and biases induced by abnormal movements in response to baited detectors. The estimator is freely available in Program MARK.},

  abstract = {The robust design has become popular among animal ecologists as a means for estimating population abundance and related demographic parameters with mark-recapture data. However, two drawbacks of traditional mark-recapture are financial cost and repeated disturbance to animals. Mark-resight methodology may in many circumstances be a less expensive and less invasive alternative to mark-recapture, but the models developed to date for these data have overwhelmingly concentrated only on the estimation of abundance. Here we introduce a mark-resight model analogous to that used in mark-recapture for the simultaneous estimation of abundance, apparent survival, and transition probabilities between observable and unobservable states. The model may be implemented using standard statistical computing software, but it has also been incorporated into the freeware package Program MARK. We illustrate the use of our model with mainland New Zealand Robin (Petroica australis) data collected to ascertain whether this methodology may be a reliable alternative for monitoring endangered populations of a closely related species inhabiting the Chatham Islands. We found this method to be a viable alternative to traditional mark-recapture when cost or disturbance to species is of particular concern in long-term population monitoring programs.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we briefly review the major themes that tie the book together, emphasizing the importance of space in both ecological and sampling processes. We discuss the future of spatial capture-recapture models in ecological research and suggest that they will increase in importance and largely replace non-spatial capture-recapture models. This prediction stems from the fact that, although we have demonstrated many potential uses for SCR models, many more await to be developed. For instance, we foresee models to describe and predict the consequences of individual interactions, such as competition and territoriality. Another exciting extension is to embed explicit movement models into SCR models for inference about movement behavior, and to improve the description of the observation process. SCR models are also lagging behind non-spatial models in some important ways. For instance, at the time of this writing, no one has devised methods for accomodating misidentification, and very few methods exist for combining different sources of data. Other important extensions that we briefly cover include models for gregarious species and models for single-catch traps. Each of these extensions should be achievable, and headway has already been made in some cases. We hope this book will inspire more rapid progress, and motivate new ideas and perspectives that will ultimately increase the usefulness of SCR models for addressing important problems in ecology and conservation.},

  abstract = {Snow petrel numbers must be of the order of several millions. However, accurate population estimates are sparse although such information is necessary to monitor potential changes in the Antarctic ecosystem. A census of snow petrel nests was conducted at Casey (East Antarctica) during summer 2002-2003. Twenty percent of the ice-free areas (available nesting habitat for snow petrels) was surveyed using a "random block design". During this survey, approximately 5000 nests were located. Generalized additive and linear modelling techniques and classification trees (GAM, GLM and CT) were used to fit resource selection functions, which modelled snow petrel abundance or presence-absence in relation to a set of environmental predictors (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature and substrate types estimated in percentage cover). The effect of spatial scale on the processes that influence habitat selection was investigated using GIS as a tool to create and test models at a hierarchical range of scales - from 200 m grid-sites level to 20 m quadrats. The strong predictive value of aspect, slope and percent cover in boulder and SCREE were identified at all scales. However, the significance of environmental predictors varied with scale, indicating that spatial scale matters in detecting habitat selection processes. In general, models were improved with the addition of spatial dependence terms representing the effect of conspecific attraction (coloniality), but these models were less applicable for predictive purposes. By predicting abundance from environmental characteristics (acquired for example, using aerial photography), resource selection functions may be a useful tool to refine population estimates of several petrel species in Antarctica without requiring intensive ground surveys. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Modern animal movement modelling derives from two traditions. Lagrangian models, based on random walk behaviour, are useful for multi-step trajectories of single animals. Continuous Eulerian models describe expected behaviour, averaged over stochastic realizations, and are usefully applied to ensembles of individuals. We illustrate three modern research arenas. (i) Models of home-range formation describe the process of an animal 'settling down', accomplished by including one or more focal points that attract the animal's movements. (ii) Memory-based models are used to predict how accumulated experience translates into biased movement choices, employing reinforced random walk behaviour, with previous visitation increasing or decreasing the probability of repetition. (iii) L\'evy movement involves a step-length distribution that is over-dispersed, relative to standard probability distributions, and adaptive in exploring new environments or searching for rare targets. Each of these modelling arenas implies more detail in the movement pattern than general models of movement can accommodate, but realistic empiric evaluation of their predictions requires dense locational data, both in time and space, only available with modern GPS telemetry.},

  abstract = {Recent theory suggests that animals should switch facultatively among canonical movement modes as a complex function of internal state, landscape characteristics, motion capacity, and navigational capacity. We tested the generality of this paradigm for free-ranging elk (Cervus elaphus) over 5 orders of magnitude in time (minutes to years) and space (meters to 100 km). At the coarsest spatiotemporal scale, elk shifted from a dispersive to a home-ranging phase over the course of 1-3 years after introduction into a novel environment. At intermediate spatiotemporal scales, elk continued to alternate between movement modes. During the dispersive phase, elk alternated between encamped and exploratory modes, possibly linked to changes in motivational goals from foraging to social bonding. During the home-ranging phase, elk movements were characterized by a complex interplay between attraction to preferred habitat types and memory of previous movements across the home-range. At the finest temporal and spatial scale, elk used area-restricted search while browsing, interspersed with less sinuous paths when not browsing. Encountering a patch of high-quality food plants triggered the switch from one mode to the next, creating biphasic movement dynamics that were reinforced by local resource heterogeneity. These patterns suggest that multiphasic structure is fundamental to the movement patterns of elk at all temporal and spatial scales tested.},

To our knowledge, this is the first time that mechanistic models have been used to characterize animal home ranges. The results provide empirical support for a model formulation of movement response to scent marks, and suggest that having relo- cation data for individuals in adjacent groups is necessary to capture the spatial arrangement of home range boundaries.We then show how the model fits can be used to obtain predictions for individual movement and scent marking behavior and to predict changes in home range patterns.

To date, the principal method used to analyse the underlying determinants of animal home range patterns has been resource selection analysis (RSA), a spatially implicit approach that examines the relative frequencies of animal relocations in relation to landscape attributes. In this analysis, we adopt an alternative approach, using a series of mechanistic home range models to analyse observed patterns of territorial space-use by coyote packs in the heterogeneous landscape of Yellowstone National Park. Unlike RSAs, mechanistic home range models are derived from underlying correlated random walk models of individual movement behaviour, and yield spatially explicit predictions for patterns of space-use by individuals. As we show here, mechanistic home range models can be used to determine the underlying determinants of animal home range patterns, incorporating both movement responses to underlying landscape heterogeneities and the effects of behavioural interactions between individuals. Our analysis indicates that the spatial arrangement of coyote territories in Yellowstone is determined by the spatial distribution of prey resources and an avoidance response to the presence of neighbouring packs. We then show how the fitted mechanistic home range model can be used to correctly predict observed shifts in the patterns of coyote space-use in response to perturbation.},

In addition, mechanistic home-range models, derived from models of animal movement behaviour, promise to offer new insights into how home ranges emerge as the result of specific patterns of movements by individuals in response to their environment. Traditional methods such as kernel density estimators are likely to remain popular because of their ease of use. Large datasets make it possible to apply these methods over relatively short periods of time such as weeks or months, and these estimates may be analysed using mixed effects models, offering another approach to studying temporal variation in space-use patterns.

GPS and other technologies enable detailed tracking of animal location concurrently with acquisition of landscape data and information on individual physiology. These tools can be used to refine our understanding of the mechanistic links between behaviour and individual condition through 'spatially informed' movement models where time allocation to different behaviours affects individual survival and reproduction. For some species, socially informed models that address the movements and average fitness of differently sized groups and how they are affected by fission-fusion processes at relevant temporal scales are required. Furthermore, as most animals revisit some places and avoid others based on their previous experiences, we foresee the incorporation of long-term memory and intention in movement models. The way animals move has important consequences for the degree of mixing that we expect to find both within a population and between individuals of different species. The mixing rate dictates the level of detail required by models to capture the influence of heterogeneity and the dynamics of intra- and interspecific interaction.},

Global positioning system data from animals allow fine-scale assessments of habitat selection and typically are analyzed in a use\textendash{} availability framework, whereby animal locations are contrasted with random locations (the availability sample). Although most use\textendash{}availability methods are in fact spatial point process models, they often are fit using logistic regression. This framework offers numerous methodological challenges, for which the literature provides little guidance. Specifically, the size and spatial extent of the availability sample influences coefficient estimates potentially causing interpretational bias. We examined the influence of availability on statistical inference through simulations and analysis of serially correlated mule deer GPS data. Bias in estimates arose from incorrectly assessing and sampling the spatial extent of availability. Spatial autocorrelation in covariates, which is common for landscape characteristics, exacerbated the error in availability sampling leading to increased bias. These results have strong implications for habitat selection analyses using GPS data, which are increasingly prevalent in the literature. We recommend that researchers assess the sensitivity of their results to their availability sample and, where bias is likely, take care with interpretations and use cross validation to assess robustness},

Understanding the effects of landscape heterogeneity on the movements of large herbivores such as North American elk is considered very important for their management. Most simu- lation studies on movements of large herbivores use predetermined behavioral rules based on empirical observations, or simply on what seems reasonable for animals to do. Here we did not impose movement rules but instead we considered that animals had higher fitness (hence better performance) when they managed to avoid predators, and when they acquired important fat reserves before winter. Individual decision-making was modeled with neural networks that received as input those variables suspected to be important in determining movement efficiency. Energetic gains and losses were tracked based on known physiological characteristics of ruminants. A genetic algorithm was used to improve the overall perfor- mance of the decision processes in different landscapes and ultimately to select certain movement behaviors. We found more variability in movement patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. Emergent properties of movement paths were concentration of activities in well-defined areas and an alternation between small, localized movement with larger, exploratory movements. Even though our simulated individuals moved shorter distances that actual elk, we found similarities in several aspects of their movement patterns such as in the distributions of distance moved and turning angles, and a tendency to return to previously visited areas.},

We estimated resource selection functions (RSFs) across three scales for a threatened ungulate, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), with two objectives: (1) to infer the relative effects of two forms of anthropogenic disturbance (forestry and linear features) on woodland caribou distributions at multiple scales and (2) to estimate scale-integrated resource selection functions (SRSFs) that synthesize results across scales for management-oriented habitat suitability mapping. We found a previously undocumented scale-specific switch in woodland caribou response to two forms of anthropogenic disturbance. Caribou avoided forestry cut-blocks at broad scales according to first- and second-order RSFs and avoided linear features at fine scales according to third-order RSFs, corroborating predictions developed according to predator-mediated effects of each disturbance type. Additionally, a single SRSF validated as well as each of three single-scale RSFs when estimating habitat suitability across three different spatial scales of prediction. We demonstrate that a single SRSF can be applied to predict relative habitat suitability at both local and landscape scales in support of critical habitat identification and species recovery.},

  abstract = {1. Compared to traditional radio-collars, global positioning system (GPS) collars provide finer spatial resolution and collect locations across a broader range of spatial and temporal conditions. However, data from GPS collars are biased because vegetation and terrain interfere with the satellite signals necessary to acquire a location. Analyses of habitat selection generally proceed without correcting for this known sampling bias. We documented the effects of bias in resource selection functions (RSF) and compared the effectiveness of two bias-correction techniques. 2. The effects of environmental conditions on the probability of a GPS collar collecting a location were modelled for three brands of collar using data collected in 24-h trials at 194 test locations. The best-supported model was used to create GPS-biased data from unbiased animal locations. These data were used to assess the effects of bias given data losses in the range of 10\textendash{}40\% at both 1- and 6-h sampling intensities. We compared the sign, value and significance of coefficients derived using biased and unbiased data. 3. With 6-h locations we observed type II error rates of 30\textendash{}40\% given as little as a 10\% data loss. Biased data also produced coefficients that were significantly more negative than unbiased estimates. Increasing the sampling intensity from 6- to 1-h locations eliminated type II errors but increased the magnitude of coefficient bias. No type I errors or changes in sign were observed. 4. We applied sample weighting and iterative simulation given a 30\% data loss. For a biased vegetation type, simulation reduced more type II errors than weighting, most probably because the original sample size was re-established. However, selection for areas near trails, which was influenced by a biased vegetation type, showed fewer type II errors after weighting existing animal locations than after simulation. Both techniques corrected 100\% and $\geq$ 80\% of the biased coefficients at the 6- and 1-h sampling intensities, respectively. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that GPS error is predictable and biases the coefficients of resource selection models dependant upon the GPS sam- pling intensity and the level of data loss. We provide effective alternatives for correcting bias and discuss applying corrections under different sampling designs.},

  volume = {19},
  abstract = {Analyses of ecological data should account for the uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data. However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

  abstract = {Habitat management for bull and cow elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) may require different forest management standards because of likely sexual differences in distribution and habitat selection patterns. Current standards are based on the habitat use patterns of cow elk. Thus, we located 121 radiocollared elk (101 bulls, 20 cows) 4,527 times in the forested habitats of northcentral Idaho during 1986-90 to determine patterns of habitat selection. During winter habitat selection patterns of greater than or equal to 2-year-old and yearling bull elk were similar, but cow elk used more shrub habitats and less-open timber types. Cows typically used moderately steep areas on south-facing to west-facing aspects on the middle to lower elevational portions of the winter range. Bulls were more often found using small benches or ridgetop areas near the upper portion of hillsides. From spring through fall, elk shifted from using a high proportion of shrub and open timber habitats to use of timber habitats. In general, elk in areas with roads used habitats with greater canopy cover. This pattern was most pronounced for cow and greater than or equal to 2-year-old bull elk. Yearling bulls tended to select habitats in proportion to availability, whereas cow and greater than or equal to 2-year-old bull elk showed preference for open timber habitats during fall in non-roaded habitats and for timber habitat in areas with roads during summer and fall. Bulls tended to use higher proportions of lower slopes and stream bottoms than did cows during summer, and somewhat steeper areas during fall. Concern over forage production on summer range should be secondary to reducing disturbance and providing secure habitat during fall hunting seasons.},

  abstract = {Hypotheses for trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) decline in Rocky Mountain national parks include long-term high herbivory by elk (Cervus elaphus), decreased disturbance, climate change, and long-term low elk herbivory. Predation theory, as applied to herbivores, was used to describe alternative functional responses predicted by each hypothesis. Further, we postulated that elk behavioral patterns resulting from predation risk could also influence aspen herbivory. We tested predictions by sampling aspen density and browsing conditions in spatially separate watersheds in the Canadian Rockies, with three areas in each of three elk density levels ($\backslash$textless2, 2-4, $\backslash$textgreater4 elk/km2), and in each of four tree cover classes: recently disturbed ($\backslash$textless25 years ago), and low, moderate, and high. Plot elk use was indexed with pellet group counts classed by habitat patch type, aspen condition (open or thicket), and different distances from trails or park boundaries used by predators, hunters, or park visitors. The herbivory rate on aspen saplings ($\backslash$textgreater1 m height and $\backslash$textless1 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) fitted the predictions of a Type 2 functional response (e.g. increased rate of herbivory with decreased sapling density). The Type 2 response appeared to result from low elk use in dense aspen thickets when predation risk is high. An interaction effect in the tree cover x elk density factorial analysis indicated that recent disturbances ($\backslash$textless25 years) have incrementally increased the number of aspen saplings, but did not cause a major shift to an abundant sapling state in areas of high and moderate elk density. These results best supported the predictions of the low elk herbivory hypothesis. Anthropogenic burning combined with human and carnivore predation effects on elk (behavioral and numeric) appeared to be important in aspen's long-term persistence, and its recent decline.

We present a Bayesian approach to analyse distance sampling data applicable to line and point transects, exact and interval distance data and any detection function possibly including covariates affecting detection probabilities. We use an integrated likelihood which combines the detection and density models. For the latter, densities are related to covariates in a log-linear mixed effect Poisson model which accommodates correlated counts. We use a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for updating parameters and a reversible jump algorithm to include model selection for both the detection function and density models. The approach is applied to a large-scale experimental design study of northern bobwhite coveys where the interest was to assess the effect of establishing herbaceous buffers around agricultural fields in several states in the US on bird densities. Results were compared with those from an existing maximum likelihood approach that analyses the detection and density models in two stages. Both methods revealed an increase of covey densities on buffered fields. Our approach gave estimates with higher precision even though it does not condition on a known detection function for the density model.},

Habitat selection differed markedly among scales and seasonal ranges. During winter elk moved to ranges at lower elevations where snow water equivalents were low and selected landscapes with a mix of forest and open vegetation at all spatial scales. Areas of high vegetation diversity were selected at large spatial scales during summer, whereas elk selected less diverse areas on winter range. During summer elk selected forests that burned 12-14 y earlier, but they used these burns less than expected by chance during winter. Habitat selection by elk occurred at multiple spatial scales; thus, we cannot prescribe a single scale as being best for modelling habitat use by elk. Instead, selection of an appropriate scale will vary depending on the research question or management issue at hand.},

The use of the word "expected" here is the key point. When synthesizing complete datasets from a common population, we are assured to reduce uncertainty. However, when we work with a log-linear model to explain the complete table, because this model cannot be fitted to any of the incomplete datasets, improvement is not assured.

The population was managed under a spike-only general hunting season, with limited permits for larger males and for females. We radiomarked 190 elk (82 males and 39 females $\backslash$textgreater1 yr old and 65 males 11 months old), most with rumen transmitters and neck radiocollars; 60 elk only received rumen transmitters. We estimated annual survival using known fate models and explored survival differences among sex and age classes and in 2 potentially different vulnerability zones for males. We found little support for differences in survival between younger (2\textendash{}3-yr old) and older (4-yr old) branch-antlered males or zone differences for yearling males. A model with zone differences for branch-antlered males was the second ranked model and accounted for 14\% of the available model weight. From the best-supported models, we estimated annual survival for yearling males at 0.41 (95\% CI: 0.29\textendash{}0.53). We estimated pooled adult female survival at 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.64\textendash{}0.93); when an age-class effect was included, point estimates were higher for prime-aged females (2\textendash{}11 yr: S \textonequarter{} 0.81 [0.70\textendash{}0.88]) than for older females (12 yr: S \textonequarter{} 0.72 [0.56\textendash{}0.83]), but confidence intervals broadly overlapped. Only 1 of 7 models with a female age effect on survival was among the competitive models.

  abstract = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {A central assumption underlying the study of habitat selection is that selected habitats confer enhanced fitness. Unfortunately, this assumption is rarely tested, and in some systems, gradients of predation risk may more accurately characterize spatial variation in vital rates than gradients described by habitat selection studies. Here, we separately measured spatial patterns of both resource selection and predation risk and tested their relationships with a key demographic trait, adult female survival, for a threatened ungulate, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou Gmelin). We also evaluated whether exposure to gradients in both predation risk and resource selection value was manifested temporally through instantaneous or seasonal effects on survival outcomes. We used Cox proportional hazards spatial survival modelling to assess the relative support for 5 selection- and risk-based definitions of habitat quality, as quantified by woodland caribou adult female survival. These hypotheses included scenarios in which selection ideally mirrored survival, risk entirely drove survival, non-ideal selection correlated with survival but with additive risk effects, an ecological trap with maladaptive selection and a non-spatial effect of annual variation in weather. Indeed, we found positive relationships between the predicted values of a resource selection function (RSF) and survival, yet subsequently incorporating an additional negative effect of predation risk greatly improved models further. This revealed a positive, but non-ideal relationship between selection and survival. Gradients in these covariates were also shown to affect individual survival probability at multiple temporal scales. Exposure to increased predation risk had a relatively instantaneous effect on survival outcomes, whereas variation in habitat suitability predicted by an RSF had both instantaneous and longer-term seasonal effects on survival. Predation risk was an additive source of hazard beyond that detected through selection alone, and woodland caribou selection thus was shown to be non-ideal. Furthermore, by combining spatial adult female survival models with herd-specific estimates of recruitment in matrix population models, we estimated a spatially explicit landscape of population growth predictions for this endangered species.},

  abstract = {Sex-ratio data for adult elk (Cervus elaphus) collected from helicopters may be biased if males and females have different sighting probabilities. Sightability models can account for differential sightability if they are sex-specific or if sightability functions are the same for both sexes. I collected sightability data from a sample of radiocollared elk in Washington that included a large proportion of adult males to test 2 hypotheses about sightability: (1) male and female elk had equal sighting probabilities, and (2) the functional relationship between factors affecting sightability and the probability of sighting groups was the same for both sexes. I also tested the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of male and female elk was the same during experimental surveys. Using logistic regression modeling, I found that females were $\backslash$textgreater9 times more likely to be seen than males during surveys. A multivariate logistic model containing the variables group size and overstory canopy closure explained sighting probabilities as well as models with more parameters. Sex was related (P $\backslash$textless 0.001) to group sightability in univariate analyses, but the effect of sex was nonsignificant (P = 0.77) when group size and canopy closure were present in a multivariate model, indicating sex operated as a confounder but not an effect modifier. The spatial overlap of adult male and female elk in blocks of aerial sampling units was 67\% during the sightability trials. The distribution of male and female elk among these blocks was related to sex (P $\leq$ 0.05) and bivariate relocations from males and females were spatially distinguishable (P $\backslash$textless 0.001), indicating that males and females were spatially segregated. These results suggest that sightability models need not be sex-specific to reduce bias in sex-ratio data collected from helicopters. However, the spatial distribution of male and female elk during winter is a potential source of bias in helicopter surveys designed to yield accurate sex-ratio data if survey area boundaries are defined by the distribution of high-sightability groups, which are likely to be groups of females.},

Using existing data on the deer population spatial distribution and size, as well as data on the landscape and ecological properties (GIS) of the area inhabited by this population, we develop a habitat suitability model by automated data analysis using machine learning of classification trees. We assume that the recorded observations of deer approximate the actual spatial distribution of the deer population reasonably well. The habitat suitability models for individual animals have the form of classification trees. The induced trees are interpreted by domain experts and a generic model is proposed. The generic habitat suitability models can help determine potential unoccupied habitats for the red deer population and develop guidelines for managing the development of the red deer population and its influence on the environment. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

However, insight into this line of research may be far-reaching\textendash{}from understanding density dependence in sexual selection to improving models of disease transmission. Using elk (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus) held in enclosures, we conducted sex-stratified experiments to test how the frequency of dyadic pairings (interaction rate) and their quality (duration) responded to manipulations in exposure to density. Using proximity-logging radio collars we recorded when and for how long individuals shared a space within 1.4 m of each other. As predicted, males increased their interaction rate as density increased. Female interaction rates, however, increased initially as density increased but soon declined to become indistinguishable from rates at low density. Females interacted for longer periods at medium densities, whereas male interaction length clearly decreased as density increased. We highlight a sexually dichotomous, density-dependent response in sociality that has yet to be reported. In addition to furthering our understanding of sociobiology (e.g., implications of time constraints presented by density on dyadic interactions), our results have implications for managing communicable disease in gregarious species of livestock and wildlife.},

  abstract = {Home range size is a result of individual movements and the spatial distribution of a population. While body size, sex, and age are known to influence the area over which an animal ranges, it remains uncertain how landscape heterogeneity influences home range size. We examined elk (Cervus elaphus) seasonal home range sizes in relation to the quantity and spatial heterogeneity of forage biomass, forest cover, topography, snow-water equivalents, and landscape structure in three study landscapes: Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA; eastern slopes of the Canadian Rockies, Alberta; and northern Wisconsin, USA. We used a 95\% fixed kernel estimator to measure the home range size and location of all elk. To identify the scales at which important factors influenced home range sizes, we quantified environmental variables within the estimated home range polygon and within concentric circles with radii of 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 in from the home range center. Results indicate that there was an inverse relationship between forage biomass and summer and winter home range sizes in Alberta and Wisconsin, however the relationship was positive in Yellowstone. The size of summer and winter home ranges was positively related to percent forest cover; however this relationship was significant only when forest cover was quantified within the home range polygon or radii that were greater than or equal to 3000 in. Winter home ranges also had a positive relationship with snow-water equivalents. The predictive strength of summer home range models was greatest when landscape variables were quantified within the concentric circles with a radius of 3000 in or more, whereas the predictive strength of the winter models was greatest within the estimated home range polygon. Results suggest that elk ranging patterns reflected complex trade-offs that affect foraging, group dynamics, movement energetics, predation avoidance and thermal regulation. The multi-scale analysis indicates that elk based home ranging decisions on an area equal to their home range, but areas outside of the estimated home range were also important.},

Management units are stands 4-32. ha in size and are described using a hierarchal vegetative description including vegetation type, size class (age), and overstory canopy cover. For the most part, these stands are relatively homogeneous resulting from decades of even-aged management. Because elk (Cervus elaphus) select habitats at different scales from home ranges to microsites, it is important for managers to know how elk utilize vegetative conditions within these stands. We compared vegetative conditions at microsites selected by elk to the vegetative conditions of similarly classified stands to enable managers to better understand how timber management affects elk habitat. Within these relatively homogeneous forest stands under even-age management of the Black Hills, elk demonstrated selection for particular forest attributes. Vegetative conditions that provide cover for elk were selected for in open stands (both aspen and pine), but while in dense stands, elk selected for more open conditions. The elk hiding cover model should be adjusted for this forest. ?? 2010.},

  doi = {10.1002/jwmg.462},
  abstract = {Despite the near universal recognition that roads negatively affect wildlife, the mechanisms that elicit animal responses to roads are often ambiguous or poorly understood. We conducted a multi-year, multi-season study to assess the relative influence of roads on elk (Cervus elaphus) in a human-dominated landscape in South Dakota. We evaluated the effects of habitat covariates including security cover, forage quality, distance to roads (primary, secondary, and tertiary), and visibility from roads at the home range scale. We radio-collared 28 elk (21 adult females and 7 adult males) and calculated seasonal (winter, spring, summer, and autumn) utilization distributions (UDs). We assigned habitat covariates to use percentiles within the UDs (1\% increments; from 1 to 98 percentiles) and used spatially explicit mixed linear regression to model the relationship between use percentile and habitat covariates. For each season and sex, we evaluated 15 candidate models and used Akaike's Information Criterion weights (omega i) to identify top-ranking models. We plotted influential coefficients from these models with 95\% confidence intervals to examine the magnitude of effects. Our analysis revealed fundamental differences in response to roads, by road type, between sexes, and across seasons. Male elk established home ranges near roads devoid of vehicle traffic in winter, spring, and autumn. In summer, coinciding with peak vehicle traffic levels, male elk reduced their use of habitat that was both visible from and close to primary roads. Female elk subherds similarly responded to primary roads in spring and autumn, during times of year when they were calving and mating, respectively. In spring and summer, female elk subherds selected habitat near roads that were closed to vehicle traffic. Forage quality and security cover were influential in the periphery ($\backslash$textgreater50th use percentile) of elk home ranges, whereas road covariates were more influential towards the core of elk home ranges. This analysis further demonstrates the utility of visibility from road metrics and suggests that the retention of vegetation structures that screen visibility potential from roads could be important components of elk management strategies.

Mean home-range size of adult males (36.0 km$^2$) was significantly larger than adult females (8.4 km$^2$). Seasonal home-range sizes differed significantly among seasons for both males and females, with the largest home ranges being in autumn for males (23.0 km$^2$), and winter for females (7.1 km$^2$). Inter-sexual differences in home ranges appeared to be influenced by differences in reproductive strategies and physiological needs. Both sexes exhibited strong range fidelity, although home ranges ill different years overlapped more for individual males (93-100\%) than females (71-90\%). Home ranges of red deer in BNP were substantially larger than that reported in previous studies throughout Europe, suggesting that in old-growth forests with large carnivores present (i.e., the historical situation for most of Europe), red deer need large areas to meet their seasonal and annual requirements.

  abstract = {Our objective was to examine effects of groups of mixed numbers and ages of male North American elk Cervus elaphus on the reproductive performance of females. We conducted research at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range in northeastern Oregon, USA, during 1993-2000. Each spring in late March, we released 40 female elk, eight yearling (9-month old) male elk and 2-8 branch-antlered elk (i.e. $\geq$ 2 years of age during rut the following autumn) into a 622-ha fenced pasture. Elk were gathered during autumn and early winter, and were brought to winter feeding grounds where blood samples were drawn to determine pregnancy status. The following spring, females were released into an 80-ha pasture prior to parturition. We searched for and captured newborn calves and obtained ear-punch samples for genetic analysis. We used 18 microsatellite loci to establish paternity of each calf. We varied the ratio of mature males (i.e. $\geq$ 3 years old) to female ratio from 0.03 to 0.21. As expected, mature males (older and heavier) were more successful in siring calves than were younger males. Within age classes, however, body mass in spring did not accurately predict mating success in autumn. Reproductive rates were not affected by season of grazing by cattle, yearling male to female ratio or mature male to female ratio. Sire age had no effect on mean dates of calf births or on calf weights. Neither sire age nor season of grazing by cattle had significant effects on calf weights; however, mean date of birth was significantly earlier when cattle grazing occurred during the previous autumn than when cattle grazed during the preceding spring. Furthermore, the number of calves sired by yearling males was greater when cattle grazing occurred during autumn, than when grazing occurred during spring. In the years with disruptive cattle grazing during rut, females mated not only with yearling males, in general, but often with those who were lighter in body mass during the previous spring than others in the same cohort. The extent to which those yearling males are untested in combat with older, dominant herd bulls may have genetic consequences leading to differences in fitness and subsequent reductions in calf survival.},

  abstract = {Female and male cervids often use different habitats, and patterns of habitat selection and space use by the sexes may be influenced in part by selection of different forage resources. We tested the hypothesis that female and male ruminants select habitats that differ with respect to quality and abundance of forage by evaluating sex- specific responses of North American elk (Cervus elaphus) to an experimental fuels-reduction program at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range (Starkey) in northeastern Oregon. From 2001 to 2003, 26 stands of true fir (Abies) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were mechanically thinned and burned, whereas 27 similar stands were left untreated to serve as controls. We used measured differences in forage quality and quantity to predict sex-specific responses to this habitat manipulation. We compared seasonal patterns of habitat selection between the sexes using locations from 48 female and 14 male elk collected during daily periods of peak foraging activity during spring and summer of 2005 and 2006. During spring, females selected 4-year-old bums and used 2- and 3-year-old bums in proportion to their availability, whereas males avoided all fire-treated stands. In addition, control stands were avoided by females but selected by males during spring. During summer, control stands were selected and treatment stands either were avoided or used in proportion to their availability by the sexes. Use of treated stands by female and male elk was influenced by different environmental variables across seasons, but mean overlap of utilization distributions between the sexes was higher in summer than spring. These results indicate that although fuels-reduction treatments at Starkey may have increased foraging opportunities for female elk in spring, those treatments likely were of little benefit to male elk.},

Based on observations of habitat use by elk (Cervus elaphus) in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming with regard to varying levels of wolf encounter risk, we found that our determination of whether the RSH or FSH best applied to sexual segregation varied by the scale at which we were measuring habitat use. At broad spatial scales we found no significant avoidance of wolves by elk. At the habitat scale we found that habitat use by elk was consistent with predictions of the reproductive strategy in that female elk used habitats that offered a balance of forage and escape terrain for themselves and calves, and that the degree to which escape terrain was present was dependent upon the risk of wolf encounter. At the scale of the habitat patch we found that differences in forage availability likely drove the differences in habitat use. Our results highlight the importance of scale when investigating habitat use, nonlethal predation effects, and sexual segregation in ungulates.},

  volume = {85},
  issn = {0022-2372},
  doi = {10.1644/BBL-002.1},
  abstract = {The concept of sexual segregation was 1st formally proposed by Charles Darwin. Among mammals, ruminants have been the focus of most research on this phenomenon. Sexual segregation has been defined traditionally as the differential use of space (and often habitat and forage) by sexes outside the mating season, but other hypotheses related to activity patterns of sexes recently have been forwarded. These new hypotheses, however, cannot explain the spatial separation of sexes or their differential use of habitats and forages. Sexual segregation should be considered in a niche framework wherein overlap on 1 niche axis is accompanied by avoidance on another, including space, diet, and habitat. Moreover, sexual segregation is scale sensitive, which limits the usefulness of a comparative approach in investigating differences among species or populations. Failure to discriminate between the potential evolutionary causes of sexual dimorphism in ruminants has led to confusion over whether polygyny or intersexual competition has led to sexual segregation. Neither exploitive nor interference competition, wherein males are competitively excluded by females, is a likely cause of sexual segregation. I suggest that the gastrocentric model, which invokes allometric and life-history differences between sexes, or risk of predation are the only hypotheses necessary to explain sexual segregation. Additional research, however, is necessary to verify some aspects of those hypotheses. The management and conservation of ruminants requires consideration that sexes behave as if they were different species, which holds consequences for estimating populations, manipulating harvest and habitats, and the potential spread of diseases and parasites and might have genetic consequences for some populations. This review attempts to resolve long-standing problems related to studies of sexual segregation, but much research remains to be accomplished, including more manipulative experiments.},

We estimated population sizes for elk (Cervus elaphus) in Michigan (1986 and 1991) and in Washington's Green River watershed (1993 and 1996) by reconstruction from harvest numbers, sex and age ratios, and mortality estimates. We constructed confidence intervals for the population estimates using parametric bootstrapping and compared the estimates with independent population estimates using mark-resight (Green River), total count (Michigan), and aerial sightability (Michigan) methods. Population estimates from reconstruction did not differ from other population estimates, and confidence interval widths (30-66\% of mean estimates) were comparable to the other techniques (22-47\%) despite less sampling effort. Because harvest numbers and herd sex and age composition are commonly collected for elk population trend analysis, population estimation from these parameters can provide managers with a simple and useful tool to complement other population assessment techniques.},

  title = {Survival and Population Growth of a Free-Ranging Elk Population with a Long History of Exposure to Chronic Wasting Disease},
  volume = {78},
  abstract = {Investigations of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal, contagious prion disease of free-ranging cervids, suggest the disease can cause long-term population declines in deer (Odocoileus spp.). However, the implications of CWD for elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) populations are less certain. During 2008-2010, we used rectal biopsies and telemetry to observe disease transmission and survival in adult female elk from a high-density herd in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) that had been infected by CWD for over 25 years. We studied a cohort of 123 adult female elk that were determined to be free of CWD by rectal biopsy in 2008. Annual incidence of CWD was 0.08 [95\% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) = 0.05, 0.12]. Annual survival probabilities of the cohort excluding harvest declined from 0.97 in 2008 (BCI = 0.93, 0.99) to 0.85 in 2010 (BCI = 0.75, 0.93). Declines in survival were attributed almost entirely to CWD; the proportion of radiocollared elk that died of CWD increased from 0.02 in 2008 (BCI = 0.00, 0.05) to 0.11 in 2010 (BCI = 0.04, 0.21). We attributed the increase to the time lag required for development of new CWD cases. We used survival rates of susceptible and infected elk to develop a projection matrix for a discrete time, female only model that estimated the intrinsic population growth rate ($\lambda$) of this elk herd to be 1.00 (BCI = 0.93, 1.05) using the prevalence of CWD (12.9\%) and calf:cow ratios (24:100) observed during this study. Population declines were predicted to occur when prevalence of CWD exceeded 13\% (BCI = 0, 35). However, this estimate was contingent on calf:cow ratios and harvest. Greater recruitment will offset some of the effects of CWD, whereas the inclusion of female harvest, which was excluded from this study, would likely result in lower $\lambda$ values than those observed in this study. We conclude that CWD can exceed natural rates of mortality, reduce survival of adult females, and decrease population growth of elk herds. Published 2014.

  volume = {86},
  abstract = {In many areas of the world, populations of native ungulates have become so abundant that they are believed to be harming vegetation and disrupting ecosystem function. Methods for controlling overabundance populations include culling animals from the population and controlling fertility using contraceptives. However, understanding the feasibility these alternatives requires insight into their long-term effects on populations. We constructed a simulation model to evaluate options for regulating elk populations in and around Rocky Mountain National Park and used the model to compare different treatment options. Methods were evaulated with respect to the time required to reduce the population to a target level, the number of animals treated and/or culled and the risk of extinction. We contrasted culling with lifetime-effect contraceptives and yearlong contraceptives. Lifetime contraceptives required treating the fewest animals to maintain the population at desired targets. However, this approach also causes the greatest population variability and potential risk of extinction. Yearlong contraceptives required treatment of dramatically more animals but had essentially no extinction risk whereas culling produced intermediate levels of both extinction risk and number of animals treated. These results characterize the risks and benefits of alternative control strategies for overabundant wildlife. They emerge from a modeling approach that can be broadly useful in helping managers in choose between alternatives for regulating overabundant wildlife.},

We measured precision of replicated field classifications of antlerless elk conducted during 1996-1999 on the National Elk Refuge, Wyoming. We found classification discrepancies of 14\% for elk calves. Next we examined morphometrics collected from 349 individuals from 2 populations of elk in northwest Wyoming. A model constructed from the combined data set accurately predicted the ages of 93\% of calves, yearlings, and adults. There were age-specific, quantitative differences in head morphology among calf, yearling, and adult elk. Using quantitative differences and photographic images, we developed illustrations and descriptions that can help observers distinguish calves from older elk. Use of these guides should improve indexing of population recruitment, based on calf:cow ratios, that wildlife mangers use to model population growth and to design annual harvests.},

  abstract = {The Trivers\textendash{}Willard (1973) model suggests maternal control of offspring sex, in utero or by the end of parental investment, may be an adaptive advantage in some species. We tested for differential sex allocation using 11,408 known-sex fetal elk (Cervus elaphus) from biological collections and hunter harvest returns from 2 southwestern Montana, USA, elk populations (1961\textendash{}2007). We included maternal and environmental condition covariates measured pre- and postconception and throughout pregnancy. Results suggested that adult female elk in southwest Montana did not differentially invest in male offspring when conditions were beneficial. We found evidence that, when the Northern Yellowstone elk herd was at low density, beneficial spring (May\textendash{}Jun) growing conditions, as indexed by a local precipitation measure and a regional drought indicator, correlated with production of more female fetuses (1 SD increase in precipitation and 1 SD decrease in drought resulted in 6\% and 5\% more F fetuses, respectively). In the same herd, we found evidence that improved maternal condition, as indexed by kidney fat mass and heart fat mass, also correlated with production of more female fetuses (1 SD increase in kidney fat mass and heart fat mass resulted in 8\% more F fetuses). When the same elk herd reached higher densities under different ecological conditions, no covariate was associated with a deviation in the 50:50 female-to-male sex ratio. Similarly, there was no association between covariates and fetal sex ratios in a nearby elk herd at high population density. In modeling, wildlife managers should consider factors that could alter sex ratios at birth, and also how biased sex ratios postpartum could affect population models},

  abstract = {Trivers and Willard's suggestion that natural selection favors maternal control of offspring sex ratio in relation to maternal condition has been much debated. The theoretical plausibility of the idea, under some conditions, is firmly established, and there is strong empirical support for conditional sex allocation in some taxa. However, the extent to which this hypothesis can be applied to mammals, particularly ungulates, has been more controversial. We used meta-analysis to review published studies of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis within ungulates and to assess the overall level of empirical support for the hypothesis. Overall, data from 37 studies of 18 species suggested a weak but significant positive correlation between maternal condition and sex ratio (r=+0.09). However, average effect size differed markedly between different categories of studies. Studies using measures of maternal condition that were taken preconception and on the basis of behavioral dominance provided strong evidence for a relationship between maternal condition and the sex ratio (r=+0.17-0.25). In contrast, studies that used morphological or physiological measures of condition that were measured postconception provided little or no evidence for a relationship between maternal condition and sex ratio (r=+0.05-0.06). There are several reasons to suggest that data collected postconception and relying on morphological measures of condition are less likely to capture variables that cause selection for biased sex allocation. In addition, we found that the relationship between sex ratio and maternal condition depended on life-history characteristics; relationships were stronger when sexual size dimorphism was more male biased and when gestation periods were longer. Overall, our analyses suggest that data from ungulates are consistent with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis but only when appropriate measures are used.},

  abstract = {1.Distance sampling is a widely used technique for estimating the size or density of biological populations. Many distance sampling designs and most analyses use the software Distance.2.We briefly review distance sampling and its assumptions, outline the history, structure and capabilities of Distance, and provide hints on its use.3.Good survey design is a crucial prerequisite for obtaining reliable results. Distance has a survey design engine, with a built-in geographic information system, that allows properties of different proposed designs to be examined via simulation, and survey plans to be generated.4.A first step in analysis of distance sampling data is modelling the probability of detection. Distance contains three increasingly sophisticated analysis engines for this: conventional distance sampling, which models detection probability as a function of distance from the transect and assumes all objects at zero distance are detected; multiple-covariate distance sampling, which allows covariates in addition to distance; and mark-recapture distance sampling, which relaxes the assumption of certain detection at zero distance.5.All three engines allow estimation of density or abundance, stratified if required, with associated measures of precision calculated either analytically or via the bootstrap.6.Advanced analysis topics covered include the use of multipliers to allow analysis of indirect surveys (such as dung or nest surveys), the density surface modelling analysis engine for spatial and habitat modelling, and information about accessing the analysis engines directly from other software.7.Synthesis and applications. Distance sampling is a key method for producing abundance and density estimates in challenging field conditions. The theory underlying the methods continues to expand to cope with realistic estimation situations.

  abstract = {Clusters or groups of individuals are the fundamental unit of observation in many wildlife sampling problems, including aerial surveys of waterfowl, marine mammals, and ungulates. Explicit accounting of cluster size in models for estimating abundance is necessary because detection of individuals within clusters is not independent and detectability of clusters is likely to increase with cluster size. This induces a cluster size bias in which the average cluster size in the sample is larger than in the population at large. Thus, failure to account for the relationship between delectability and cluster size will tend to yield a positive bias in estimates of abundance or density. I describe a hierarchical modeling framework for accounting for cluster-size bias in animal sampling. The hierarchical model consists of models for the observation process conditional on the cluster size distribution and the cluster size distribution conditional on the total number of clusters. Optionally, a spatial model can be specified that describes variation in the total number of clusters per sample unit. Parameter estimation, model selection, and criticism may be carried out using conventional likelihood-based methods. An extension of the model is described for the situation where measurable covariates at the level of the sample unit are available. Several candidate models within the proposed class are evaluated for aerial survey data on mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).},

  abstract = {Data augmentation (DA) is a flexible tool for analyzing closed and open population models of capturerecapture data, especially models which include sources of hetereogeneity among individuals. The essential concept underlying DA, as we use the term, is based on adding observations to create a dataset composed of a known number of individuals. This new (augmented) dataset, which includes the unknown number of individuals N in the population, is then analyzed using a new model that includes a reformulation of the parameter N in the conventional model of the observed (unaugmented) data. In the context of capturerecapture models, we add a set of all zero encounter histories which are not, in practice, observable. The model of the augmented dataset is a zero-inflated version of either a binomial or a multinomial base model. Thus, our use of DA provides a general approach for analyzing both closed and open population models of all types. In doing so, this approach provides a unified framework for the analysis of a huge range of models that are treated as unrelated black boxes and named procedures in the classical literature. As a practical matter, analysis of the augmented dataset by MCMC is greatly simplified compared to other methods that require specialized algorithms. For example, complex capturerecapture models of an augmented dataset can be fitted with popular MCMC software packages (WinBUGS or JAGS) by providing a concise statement of the models assumptions that usually involves only a few lines of pseudocode. In this paper, we review the basic technical concepts of data augmentation, and we provide examples of analyses of closed-population models (M 0, M h , distance sampling, and spatial capturerecapture models) and open-population models (JollySeber) with individual effects.},

  doi = {10.1111/1365-2664.12065},
  abstract = {1. There is currently much interest in replacing the design-based component of conventional distance sampling methods by a modelling approach where animal densities are related to environmental covariates. These models allow identification of relationships between density and covariates. One of the uses of such models is to assess the effects of some intervention on numbers for species of conservation interest in designed distance sampling experiments. 2. In this context, we use an integrated likelihood approach for modelling sample counts, adopting a Poisson model and allowing imperfect detectability on the sample plots. We use the method of Royle, Dawson \& Bates (2004, Ecology, 85, 1591), extended to model heteroge- neity in detection probabilities using either multiple covariate distance sampling methods or stratification. Moreover, we include a random effect for site in the plot abundance model to accommodate correlation in repeat counts at a single site. 3. These developments were motivated by a large-scale experimental study to assess the effects of establishing conservation buffers along field margins on indigo buntings in several US states. We analyse the data using an integrated likelihood and include model selection for both the Poisson rate of counts and detection probabilities. We assess model performance by comparing our results with those using a two-stage approach (Buckland et al. 2009, Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics, 14, 432) which we extended by includ- ing a random effect for site in the plot abundance model. 4. The two methods led to the same selected models and gave similar results for parameters, which revealed significant beneficial effects of buffers on indigo bunting densities. Densities on buffered fields were on average 35\% higher than on unbuffered fields. Using a detection function stratified by state captured some of the heterogeneity in detection probabilities between the nine states included in the analyses. 5. Synthesis and applications. We develop and compare two methods for analysing data from large-scale distance sampling experiments with imbalanced repeat measures. By including a random site effect in the plot abundance model, we relax the assumption of independent sam- ple counts which is generally made for distance sampling methods, and we allow inference to be drawn for the wider region that the sites represent.},

  abstract = {1. Estimating temporal trends in animal abundance is central to ecology and conservation, but obtaining useful trend estimates is challenging when animal detection rates vary across surveys (e.g. because of differences in observers or conditions). Methods exist for obtaining abundance estimates using capturerecapture and distance sampling protocols, but only recently have some of these been extended to allow direct estimation of abundance trends when detection rates vary. Extensions to distance sampling for $\backslash$textgreater2surveys have not yet been demonstrated. 2. We demonstrate a Bayesian approach for estimating abundance and population trends, using a time series of line-transect data for endangered fin whales Balaenoptera physalus off the west coast of the United States. We use a hierarchical model to partition state and observation processes. Population density is modelled as a function of covariates and random process terms, while observed counts are modelled as an overdispersed Poisson process with rates estimated as a function of population density and detection probability, which is modelled using distance sampling theory. We used Deviance Information Criteria to make multi-model inference about abundance and trend estimates. 3. Bayesian posterior distributions for trend parameters provide strong evidence of increasing fin whale abundance in the California Current study area from 1991 to 2008, while individual abundance estimates during survey years were considerably more precise than previously reported estimates using the same data. Assuming no change in underlying population dynamics, we predict continued increases in fin whale numbers over the next decade. Our abundance projections account for both sampling error in parameter estimates and process variance in annual abundance about the mean trend. 4. Synthesis and applications. Bayesian hierarchical modelling offers numerous benefits for analysing animal abundance trends. In our case, these included its implicit handling of sampling covariance, flexibility to accommodate random effects and covariates, ability to compare trend models of different functional forms and ability to partition sampling and process error to make predictions. Ultimately, by placing distance sampling within a more general hierarchical framework, we obtained more precise abundance estimates and an inference about fin whale trends that would have otherwise been difficult.},

  title = {Modeling {{Abundance Effects}} in {{Distance Sampling}}},
  volume = {85},
  abstract = {Distance-sampling methods are commonly used in studies of animal populations to estimate population density. A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abundance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.

  abstract = {Three of the 4 species of giant sengis or elephant shrews (genus Rhynchocyon) have restricted geographic distributions in eastern Africa and are threatened by anthropogenic habitat loss. However, little is known about their ecology and habitat relationships. We used remotely triggered cameras to detect the gray-faced sengi (Rhynchocyon udzungwensis), which is endemic in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania, with the aim of defining distributional limits, estimating occupancy patterns, and determining habitat requirements. We deployed 183 camera stations over 6 years and accumulated 4,600 camera trapping days. We refined the area of known occurrence to be 390 km2, thus confirming the species' restricted range and vulnerability. We estimated the average occupancy at 56\% of sites occupied on sites sampled, and found that occupancy was best predicted by the forest habitat type, with interior, closed-canopy forest supporting highest estimated sengi occupancy. Terrain slope and distance to the nearest park boundary were less important covariates, but nevertheless included among the best models. Camera-trapping rate (photographic events by day) was significantly correlated with subcanopy tree coverage. Combined, these habitat features may provide optimal conditions for antipredation vigilance (vegetation cover), and for nest-building and/or foraging on invertebrates in the thicker leaf litter on gentle slopes. Our results offer new insights into the ecology of giant sengis and confirm the potential utility of camera trapping for occupancy analysis of small, forest-dwelling mammals.},

Distance sampling has been widely used to estimate abundance (or density) of animals or plants in a spatially explicit study area. There is, however, no readily available method of making statistical inference on the relationships between abundance and environmental covariates. Spatial Poisson process likelihoods can be used to simultaneously estimate detection and intensity parameters by modeling distance sampling data as a thinned spatial point process. A model-based spatial approach to distance sampling data has three main benefits: it allows complex and opportunistic transect designs to be employed, it allows estimation of abundance in small subregions, and it provides a framework to assess the effects of habitat or experimental manipulation on density. We demonstrate the model-based methodology with a small simulation study and analysis of the Dubbo weed data set. In addition, a simple ad hoc method for handling overdispersion is also proposed. The simulation study showed that the model-based approach compared favorably to conventional distance sampling methods for abundance estimation. In addition, the overdispersion correction performed adequately when the number of transects was high. Analysis of the Dubbo data set indicated a transect effect on abundance via Akaike's information criterion model selection. Further goodness-of-fit analysis, however, indicated some potential confounding of intensity with the detection function.},

The Bayesian approach is compared to a standard line-transect analysis using both real and simulated data. Results of the Bayesian and non-Bayesian analyses are similar when there are no prior data on effective strip width or density, but the Bayesian approach performs better when such data are available from previous or related studies. Practical methods for including prior data on effective strip width and density are suggested. A numerical example shows how the Bayesian approach can provide valid estimates when the sample size is too small for the standard approach to work reliably.

  abstract = {Ecologists often use multiple observer transect surveys to census animal populations. In addition to animal counts, these surveys produce sequences of detections and non-detections for each observer. When combined with additional data (i.e. covariates such as distance from the transect line), these sequences provide the additional information to estimate absolute abundance when detectability on the transect line is less than one. Although existing analysis approaches for such data have proven extremely useful, they have some limitations. For instance, it is difficult to extrapolate from observed areas to unobserved areas unless a rigorous sampling design is adhered to; it is also difficult to share information across spatial and temporal domains or to accommodate habitat-abundance relationships. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical modeling framework for multiple observer line transects that removes these limitations. In particular, abundance intensities can be modeled as a function of habitat covariates, making it easier to extrapolate to unsampled areas. Our approach relies on a complete data representation of the state space, where unobserved animals and their covariates are modeled using a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Observer detections are modeled via a bivariate normal distribution on the probit scale, with dependence induced by a distance-dependent correlation parameter. We illustrate performance of our approach with simulated data and on a known population of golf tees. In both cases, we show that our hierarchical modeling approach yields accurate inference about abundance and related parameters. In addition, we obtain accurate inference about population-level covariates (e.g. group size). We recommend that ecologists consider using hierarchical models when analyzing multiple-observer transect data, especially when it is difficult to rigorously follow pre-specified sampling designs. We provide a new R package, hierarchicalDS, to facilitate the building and fitting of these models.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and moose (Alces alces shirasi) in North America. In southeastern Wyoming average annual CWD prevalence in mule deer exceeds 20\% and appears to contribute to regional population declines. We determined the effect of CWD on mule deer demography using age-specific, female-only, CWD transition matrix models to estimate the population growth rate ($\lambda$). Mule deer were captured from 2010\textendash{}2014 in southern Converse County Wyoming, USA. Captured adult ($\geq$ 1.5 years old) deer were tested ante-mortem for CWD using tonsil biopsies and monitored using radio telemetry. Mean annual survival rates of CWD-negative and CWD-positive deer were 0.76 and 0.32, respectively. Pregnancy and fawn recruitment were not observed to be influenced by CWD. We estimated $\lambda$ = 0.79, indicating an annual population decline of 21\% under current CWD prevalence levels. A model derived from the demography of only CWD-negative individuals yielded; $\lambda$ = 1.00, indicating a stable population if CWD were absent. These findings support CWD as a significant contributor to mule deer population decline. Chronic wasting disease is difficult or impossible to eradicate with current tools, given significant environmental contamination, and at present our best recommendation for control of this disease is to minimize spread to new areas and na\"ive cervid populations.},

  abstract = {Studies of demographic processes are typically restricted to small geographic areas and short time periods due to the costs of marking and monitoring individuals. However, environmental changes are occurring at much broader spatial and temporal scales, and thus, inferences about the mechanisms governing population dynamics need to be scaled accordingly. Recently developed integrated population models (IPMs) represent an approach for doing so, by jointly analysing survey data and capture\textendash{}recapture data.Although promising, several shortcomings of conventional IPMs exist, including difficulties accounting for spatial variation in demographic, movement and detection parameters; limited ability to make spatially explicit predictions of abundance or vital rates; and a requirement that the survey data and the capture\textendash{}recapture data are independent. We demonstrate how each of these limitations can be resolved by adopting a spatial population dynamics model upon which both the survey data and the capture\textendash{}recapture data are conditioned.We applied the model to 6 years of hair data collected on the threatened Louisiana black bear Ursus americanus luteolus. For years in which the hair samples were genotyped, the resulting data are information-rich (but expensive) spatial capture\textendash{}recapture (SCR) data. For the remaining years, the data are binary detection data, of the type often analysed using occupancy models. We compared estimates of demographic parameters and annual abundance using various combinations of the SCR and detection data, and found that combining the SCR data and the detection data resulted in more precise estimates of abundance relative to estimates that did not use the detection data. A simulation study provided additional evidence of increased precision, as well as evidence that the estimators of annual abundance are approximately unbiased. The ability to combine survey data and capture\textendash{}recapture data using a spatially explicit model opens many possibilities for designing cost effective studies and scaling up inferences about the demographic processes influencing spatial and temporal population dynamics.},

We document an unusual long-distance movement of a young female, out of the chronic wasting disease eradication zone in south-central Wisconsin. This type of movement could function as a rapid, long-distance dispersing mechanism for the disease only if the following conditions are met: the deer is infected and shedding prions, the deer directly contacts other deer and transmits secretions carrying an infectious dose of prions, or an infectious dose of prions is transmitted to the environment and taken up by other deer. Despite lower prevalence rates of chronic wasting disease among young deer, we believe managers should not dismiss deer making long-distance movements such as we report, as they could serve as potential long-distance vectors of the disease.},

  abstract = {1. An extensive post-mortem survey of grouse revealed that birds killed by predators in spring and summer had significantly greater burdens of the caecal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis than grouse shot during the autumn. Furthermore, grouse that appeared to have died through the effects of parasites carried greater worm burdens than grouse killed by predators. 2. The proportion of grouse with high levels of parasite infection increased with the intensity of predator control as measured indirectly through keeper density. These two empirical observations suggest that predators selectively prey on heavily infected grouse. 3. The interactions between parasites and predators were examined experimentally by reducing the worm burdens of female grouse with an oral anthelmintic. Nests of treated and untreated females were subsequently located either by research workers flushing the incubating female or by dogs trained to locate birds by scent. The dogs found significantly fewer of the treated than control birds, suggesting that female grouse with large parasite burdens emit more scent and are more vulnerable to mammalian predation. 4. A modified mathematical model of the grouse--nematode system is described which incorporates the effects of both random and selective predation of heavily parasitized grouse. An analysis of the model illustrates the importance of interactions between grouse, parasites and predators in determining the relative densities of each. In particular, when predators selectively remove heavily parasitized individuals, then low levels of predation can lead to increases in the size of the host (or prey) population.},

Scoping review methods were applied to objectively assess the relative interest by the scientific community in infectious diseases at interfaces between wildlife and livestock, to characterize animal species and regions involved, as well as to identify trends over time. An extensive literature search combining wildlife, livestock, disease, and geographical search terms yielded 78,861 publications, of which 15,998 were included in the analysis. Publications dated from 1912 to 2013 and showed a continuous increasing trend, including a shift from parasitic to viral diseases over time. In particular there was a significant increase in publications on the artiodactyls\textendash{}cattle and bird\textendash{}poultry interface after 2002 and 2003, respectively. These trends could be traced to key disease events that stimulated public interest and research funding. Among the top 10 diseases identified by this review, the majority were zoonoses. Prominent wildlife\textendash{}livestock interfaces resulted largely from interaction between phylogenetically closely related and/or sympatric species. The bird\textendash{}poultry interface was the most frequently cited wildlife\textendash{}livestock interface worldwide with other interfaces reflecting regional circumstances.

  abstract = {Analyses of animal movement data have primarily focused on understanding patterns of space use and the behavioural processes driving them. Here, we analyzed animal movement data to infer components of individual fitness, specifically parturition and neonate survival. We predicted that parturition and neonate loss events could be identified by sudden and marked changes in female movement patterns. Using GPS radio-telemetry data from female woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), we developed and tested two novel movement-based methods for inferring parturition and neonate survival. The first method estimated movement thresholds indicative of parturition and neonate loss from population-level data then applied these thresholds in a moving-window analysis on individual time-series data. The second method used an individual-based approach that discriminated among three a priori models representing the movement patterns of non-parturient females, females with surviving offspring, and females losing offspring. The models assumed that step lengths (the distance between successive GPS locations) were exponentially distributed and that abrupt changes in the scale parameter of the exponential distribution were indicative of parturition and offspring loss. Both methods predicted parturition with near certainty ($>$97\% accuracy) and produced appropriate predictions of parturition dates. Prediction of neonate survival was affected by data quality for both methods; however, when using high quality data (i.e., with few missing GPS locations), the individual-based method performed better, predicting neonate survival status with an accuracy rate of 87\%. Understanding ungulate population dynamics often requires estimates of parturition and neonate survival rates. With GPS radio-collars increasingly being used in research and management of ungulates, our movement-based methods represent a viable approach for estimating rates of both parameters.},

  doi = {10.1098/rstb.2016.0084},
  abstract = {Transmission is a fundamental step in the life cycle of every parasite but it is also one of the most challenging processes to model and quantify. In most host\textendash{}parasite models, the transmission process is encapsulated by a single parameter $\beta$. Many different biological processes and interactions, acting on both hosts and infectious organisms, are subsumed in this single term. There are, however, at least two undesirable consequences of this high level of abstraction. First, nonlinearities and heterogeneities that can be critical to the dynamic behaviour of infections are poorly represented; second, estimating the transmission coefficient $\beta$ from field data is often very difficult. In this paper, we present a conceptual model, which breaks the transmission process into its component parts. This deconstruction enables us to identify circumstances that generate nonlinearities in transmission, with potential implications for emergent transmission behaviour at individual and population scales. Such behaviour cannot be explained by the traditional linear transmission frameworks. The deconstruction also provides a clearer link to the empirical estimation of key components of transmission and enables the construction of flexible models that produce a unified understanding of the spread of both micro- and macro-parasite infectious disease agents.This article is part of the themed issue `Opening the black box: re-examining the ecology and evolution of parasite transmission'.},

Individual-level variation can emerge in each of these components through a combination of behavioural and physiological mechanisms.

* In this review, we describe mechanisms that promote variation in the number of individuals to which an individual transmits a pathogen, emphasizing insights that can be gained by understanding which components of transmission (infectiousness, contact rate, infection duration) are primarily affected.

* Strategies for quantifying each transmission component are presented, and we discuss why studies focusing on only one component of the infection process may be misleading.

We review our ecological understanding of wildlife infectious diseases from the individual host to the ecosystem scale, highlighting where conceptual thinking lacks verification, discussing difficulties and challenges, and offering potential future research directions. 2. New molecular approaches hold potential to increase our understanding of parasite interactions within hosts. Also, advances in our knowledge of immune systems makes immunological parameters viable measures of parasite exposure, and useful tools for improving our understanding of causal mechanisms. 3. Studies of transmission dynamics have revealed the importance of heterogeneity in host behaviour and physiology, and of contact processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales. An important future challenge is to determine the key transmission mechanisms maintaining the persistence of different types of diseases in the wild. 4. Regulation of host populations is too complex to consider parasite effects in isolation from other factors. One solution is to seek a unified understanding of the conditions under which (and the ecological rules determining when) population scale impacts of parasites can occur. 5. Good evidence now shows that both direct effects of parasites, and trait mediated indirect effects, frequently mediate the success of invasive species and their impacts on recipient communities. A wider exploration of these effects is now needed. 6. At the ecosystem scale, research is needed to characterize the circumstances and conditions under which both fluxes in parasite biomass, and trait mediated effects, are significant in ecosystem processes, and to demonstrate that parasites do indeed increase 'ecosystem health'. 7. There is a general need for more empirical testing of predictions and subsequent development of theory in the classic research cycle. Experimental field studies, meta-analyses, the collection and analysis of long-term data sets, and data constrained modelling, will all be key to advancing our understanding. 8. Finally, we are only now beginning to understand the importance of cross-scale interactions associated with parasitism. Such interactions may offer key insights into bigger picture questions such as when and how different regulatory factors are important, when disease can cause species extinctions, and what characteristics are indicative of functionally resilient ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Behavioural phenotypes may provide a means for identifying individuals that disproportionally contribute to disease spread and epizootic outbreaks. For example, bolder phenotypes may experience greater exposure and susceptibility to pathogenic infection because of distinct interactions with conspecifics and their environment. We tested the value of behavioural phenotypes in larval amphibians for predicting ranavirus transmission in experimental trials. We found that behavioural phenotypes characterized by latency-to-food and swimming profiles were predictive of disease susceptibility and infectiousness defined as the capacity of an infected host to transmit an infection by contacts. While viral shedding rates were positively associated with transmission, we also found an inverse relationship between contacts and infections. Together these results suggest intrinsic traits that influence behaviour and the quantity of pathogens shed during conspecific interactions may be an important contributor to ranavirus transmission. These results suggest that behavioural phenotypes provide a means to identify individuals more likely to spread disease and thus give insights into disease outbreaks that threaten wildlife and humans.},

  doi = {10.1111/2041-210X.12572},
  abstract = {Estimating survival and recruitment over large spatial scales is extremely challenging because it requires `expensive' demographic data from marked animals. Dynamic N-mixture models (Dail \& Madsen 2011) yield estimates of abundance, apparent survival, recruitment and detection probability from simple counts replicated in space and time, as frequently collected in monitoring programmes all over the world. However, the vital rates are assumed to be density-independent and constant over time, arguably unrealistic assumptions in many situations. We evaluated the performance of the traditional dynamic N-mixture model from simulated data generated with density dependence and environmental stochasticity in the vital rates. We then developed a series of more advanced models that take density-dependent vital rates and environmental stochasticity into account and assessed whether these models provide accurate estimates of vital rates, strength of density dependence and levels of environmental stochasticity. We found that the traditional Dail\textendash{}Madsen model produced accurate estimates of abundances and vital rates when the assumptions were met, but not when vital rates were subject to density dependence and environmental stochasticity. Accurate parameter estimates were generally obtained when the data generation matched the data analysis model, but accuracy was substantially reduced otherwise. Interestingly, accurate estimates of abundance and detection were obtained from all models, regardless of the data generation model. Shorter time series from more sites yielded estimates of similar accuracy as longer series from fewer sites. The new dynamic N-mixture models represent a promising basis for developing integrated population models that combine data from different sources to get insights into population dynamics of species over large areas.

  abstract = {To successfully respond to changing habitat, climate or harvest, managers need to identify the most effective strategies to reverse population trends of declining species and/or manage harvest of game species. A classic approach in conservation biology for the last two decades has been the use of matrix population models to determine the most important vital rates affecting population growth rate ($\lambda$), that is, sensitivity. Ecologists quickly realized the critical role of environmental variability in vital rates affecting $\lambda$ by developing approaches such as life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) that account for both sensitivity and variability of a vital rate. These LSA methods used matrix-population modeling and Monte Carlo simulation methods, but faced challenges in integrating data from different sources, disentangling process and sampling variation, and in their flexibility. Here, we developed a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) for two populations of a large herbivore, elk (Cervus canadensis) in Montana, USA. We then extended the IPM to evaluate sensitivity in a Bayesian framework. We integrated known-fate survival data from radio-marked adults and juveniles, fecundity data, and population counts in a hierarchical population model that explicitly accounted for process and sampling variance. Next, we tested the prevailing paradigm in large herbivore population ecology that juvenile survival of neonates $<$90~d old drives $\lambda$ using our Bayesian LSA approach. In contrast to the prevailing paradigm in large herbivore ecology, we found that adult female survival explained more of the variation in $\lambda$ than elk calf survival, and that summer and winter elk calf survival periods were nearly equivalent in importance for $\lambda$. Our Bayesian IPM improved precision of our vital rate estimates and highlighted discrepancies between count and vital rate data that could refine population monitoring, demonstrating that combining sensitivity analysis with population modeling in a Bayesian framework can provide multiple advantages. Our Bayesian LSA framework will provide a useful approach to addressing conservation challenges across a variety of species and data types.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy that was first detected in 1967 in a captive research facility in Colorado. In the northeastern United States, CWD was first confirmed in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in 2005. Because CWD is a new and emerging disease with a spatial distribution that had yet to be assessed in the Northeast, we examined demographic, environmental, and spatial effects to determine how each related to this spatial distribution. The objectives of our study were to identify environmental and spatial effects that best described the spatial distribution of CWD in free-ranging white-tailed deer and identify areas that support deer that are at risk for CWD infection in the Northeast. We used Bayesian hierarchical modeling that incorporated demographic covariates, such as sex and age, along with environmental covariates, which included elevation, slope, riparian corridor, percent clay, and 3 landscapes (i.e., developed, forested, open). The model with the most support contained landscape covariates and spatial effects that represented clustering of CWD in adjacent grid cells. Forested landscapes had the strongest relationship with the distribution of CWD, with increased risk of CWD occurring in areas that had lesser amounts of forest. Our results will assist resource managers in understanding the spatial distribution of CWD within the study area, and in surrounding areas where CWD has yet to be found. Efficiency of disease surveillance and containment efforts can be improved by allocating resources used for surveillance in areas with deer populations that are at greatest risk for infection. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Although spatially explicit data on processes that generate ecological patterns, such as the distribution of disease over a landscape, are frequently unavailable, information about the scales over which processes operate can be used to understand the link between pattern and process. Our goal was to identify scales of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) movement and mixing that exerted the greatest influence on the spatial pattern of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in northcentral Colorado, USA. We hypothesized that three scales of mixing (individual, winter subpopulation, or summer subpopulation) might control spatial variation in disease prevalence. We developed a fully Bayesian hierarchical model to compare the strength of evidence for each mixing scale. We found strong evidence that the finest mixing scale corresponded best to the spatial distribution of CWD infection. There was also evidence that land ownership and habitat use play a role in exacerbating the disease, along with the known effects of sex and age. Our analysis demonstrates how information on the scales of spatial processes that generate observed patterns can be used to gain insight when process data are sparse or unavailable.},

  abstract = {Animals' social and movement behaviours can impact the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, especially for pathogens transmitted through close contact between hosts or through contact with infectious stages in the environment. Estimating pathogen transmission rates and R0 from natural systems can be challenging. Because host behavioural traits that underlie the transmission process vary predictably with body size, one of the best-studied traits among animals, body size might therefore also predict variation in parasite transmission dynamics. Here, we examine how two host behaviours, social group living and the intensity of habitat use, scale allometrically using comparative data from wild primate, carnivore and ungulate species. We use these empirical relationships to parameterize classical compartment models for infectious micro- and macroparasitic diseases, and examine how the risk of pathogen invasion changes as a function of host behaviour and body size. We then test model predictions using comparative data on parasite prevalence and richness from wild mammals. We report a general pattern suggesting that smaller-bodied mammal species utilizing home ranges more intensively experience greater risk for invasion by environmentally transmitted macroparasites. Conversely, larger-bodied hosts exhibiting a high degree of social group living could be more readily invaded by directly transmitted microparasites. These trends were supported through comparison of micro- and macroparasite species richness across a large number of carnivore, primate and ungulate species, but empirical data on carnivore macroparasite prevalence showed mixed results. Collectively, our study demonstrates that combining host behavioural traits with dynamical models of infectious disease scaled against host body size can generate testable predictions for variation in parasite risk across species; a similar approach might be useful in future work focused on predicting parasite distributions in local host communities.},

To understand the transmission dynamics and potential impact of an outbreak, several types of data are necessary. Here we build on experience gained in the West African Ebola epidemic and prior emerging infectious disease outbreaks to set out a checklist of data needed to: (1) quantify severity and transmissibility; (2) characterize heterogeneities in transmission and their determinants; and (3) assess the effectiveness of different interventions. We differentiate data needs into individual-level data (e.g. a detailed list of reported cases), exposure data (e.g. identifying where/how cases may have been infected) and population-level data (e.g. size/demographics of the population(s) affected and when/where interventions were implemented). A remarkable amount of individual-level and exposure data was collected during the West African Ebola epidemic, which allowed the assessment of (1) and (2). However, gaps in population-level data (particularly around which interventions were applied when and where) posed challenges to the assessment of (3). Here we highlight recurrent data issues, give practical suggestions for addressing these issues and discuss priorities for improvements in data collection in future outbreaks.This article is part of the themed issue `The 2013\textendash{}2016 West African Ebola epidemic: data, decision-making and disease control'.},

To close the gap between contemporary reality and demographic theory, we develop a set of transient life table response experiments (LTREs) for decomposing realised population growth rates into contributions from specific vital rates and components of population structure. Using transient LTREs in a theoretical framework, we reveal that established concepts in population biology will require revision because of reliance on approaches that do not address the influence of unstable population structure on population growth and mean fitness. Going forward, transient LTREs will enhance understanding of demography and improve the explanatory power of models used to understand ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

  abstract = {Identifying the demographic parameters (e.g., reproduction, survival, dispersal) that most influence population dynamics can increase conservation effectiveness and enhance ecological understanding. Life table response experiments (LTRE) aim to decompose the effects of change in parameters on past demographic outcomes (e.g., population growth rates). But the vast majority of LTREs and other retrospective population analyses have focused on decomposing asymptotic population growth rates, which do not account for the dynamic interplay between population structure and vital rates that shape realized population growth rates ($\lambda$t=Nt+1/Nt) in time-varying environments. We provide an empirical means to overcome these shortcomings by merging recently developed ``transient life-table response experiments'' with integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the estimation of latent population structure and other demographic parameters that are required for transient LTRE analysis, and Bayesian versions additionally allow for complete error propagation from the estimation of demographic parameters to derivations of realized population growth rates and perturbation analyses of growth rates. By integrating available monitoring data for Lesser Scaup over 60~yr, and conducting transient LTREs on IPM estimates, we found that the contribution of juvenile female survival to long-term variation in realized population growth rates was 1.6 and 3.7 times larger than that of adult female survival and fecundity, respectively. But a persistent long-term decline in fecundity explained 92\% of the decline in abundance between 1983 and 2006. In contrast, an improvement in adult female survival drove the modest recovery in Lesser Scaup abundance since 2006, indicating that the most important demographic drivers of Lesser Scaup population dynamics are temporally dynamic. In addition to resolving uncertainty about Lesser Scaup population dynamics, the merger of IPMs with transient LTREs will strengthen our understanding of demography for many species as we aim to conserve biodiversity during an era of non-stationary global change.},

Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions. Here, I review several recent studies on four diseases that show the benefits of different methodologies: measles (patch models), foot-and-mouth disease (distance-transmission models), pandemic influenza (multigroup models), and smallpox (network models). This review highlights the importance of the household in spatial studies of human diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. It also demonstrates the need to develop a simple model of household demographics, so that these large-scale models can be extended to the investigation of long\textendash{}time scale human pathogens, such as tuberculosis and HIV.},

Badgers exhibit a slow life-history strategy, having high rates of adult survival with low variance, and low but variable rates of recruitment. Recruitment exhibited strong negative density-dependence, but was not influenced by disease, while adult survival was density independent but declined with increasing prevalence of diseased individuals. Given that reproductive success is not depressed by disease prevalence, density-dependent recruitment of cubs is likely to compensate for disease-induced mortality. This combination of slow life history and compensatory recruitment promotes the persistence of a naturally infected badger population and helps to explain the badger's role as a persistent reservoir of M. bovis.},

Social structure can help dilute risks of transmission for group members, and is relatively easy to measure, but kin-association represents a further level of population sub-structure that is harder to measure, particularly when association behaviours happen underground. Here, using epidemiological and molecular genetic data from a wild, high-density population of the European badger (Meles meles), we quantify the risks of infection with Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent of tuberculosis) in cubs. The risk declines with increasing size of its social group, but this net dilution effect conceals divergent patterns of infection risk. Cubs only enjoy reduced risk when social groups have a higher proportion of test-negative individuals. Cubs suffer higher infection risk in social groups containing resident infectious adults, and these risks are exaggerated when cubs and infectious adults are closely related. We further identify key differences in infection risk associated with resident infectious males and females. We link our results to parent\textendash{}offspring interactions and other kin-biased association, but also consider the possibility that susceptibility to infection is heritable. These patterns of infection risk help to explain the observation of a herd immunity effect in badgers following low-intensity vaccination campaigns. They also reveal kinship and kin-association to be important, and often hidden, drivers of disease transmission in social mammals.},

Great apes are highly social and endangered animals that have experienced substantial population declines from directly transmitted pathogens; as such, network approaches to quantify contact heterogeneity could be crucially important for predicting infection probability and outbreak size following pathogen introduction, especially owing to challenges in collecting real-time infection data for endangered wildlife.We present here the first study using network analysis to quantify contact heterogeneity in wild apes, with applications for predicting community-wide infectious disease risk. Specifically, within a wild chimpanzee community, we ask how associations between individuals vary over time, and we identify traits of highly connected individuals that might contribute disproportionately to pathogen spread.We used field observations of behavioural encounters in a habituated wild chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda to construct monthly party level (i.e. subgroup) and close-contact (i.e. $\leq$5~m) association networks over a 9-month period.Network analysis revealed that networks were highly dynamic over time. In particular, oestrous events significantly increased pairwise party associations, suggesting that community-wide disease outbreaks should be more likely to occur when many females are in oestrus.Bayesian models and permutation tests identified traits of chimpanzees that were highly connected within the network. Individuals with large families (i.e. mothers and their juveniles) that range in the core of the community territory and to a lesser extent high-ranking males were central to association networks, and thus represent the most important individuals to target for disease intervention strategies.Overall, we show striking temporal variation in network structure and traits that predict association patterns in a wild chimpanzee community. These empirically-derived networks can inform dynamic models of pathogen transmission and have practical applications for infectious disease management of endangered wildlife species.},

Many species of conservation concern are in decline due to threats from multiple sources. To quantify the conservation requirements of these species we need robust estimates of the impact of each threat on the rate of population decline. However, for the vast majority of species this information is lacking. Here we demonstrate the application of integrated population modelling as a means of deriving robust estimates of the impact of multiple threats for a rapidly declining koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) population in South-east Queensland, Australia. Integrated population modelling provides a basis for reducing uncertainty and bias by formally integrating information from multiple data sources into a single model. We quantify mortality rates due to threats from dog attacks, vehicle collisions and disease and the extent to which each of these mortality rates would need to be reduced, or how much habitat would need to be restored, to stop the population declining. We show that the integrated population modelling approach substantially reduces uncertainty. We also show that recovery actions that only address single threats would need to reduce those threats to implausibly low levels to recover the population. This indicates that strategies for simultaneously tackling multiple threats are necessary; a situation that is likely to be true for many of the world's threatened species. This study provides an important framework for quantifying the conservation requirements of species undergoing declines due to multiple threats.},

Mass-action epidemic models are the foundation of the majority of studies of disease dynamics in human and animal populations. Here, a kinetic model of mobile susceptible and infective individuals in a two-dimensional domain is introduced, and an examination of the contact process results in a mass-action-like term for the generation of new infectives. The conditions under which density dependent and frequency dependent transmission terms emerge are clarified. Moreover, this model suggests that epidemics in large mobile spatially distributed populations can be well described by homogeneously mixing mass-action models. The analysis generates an analytic formula for the contact rate ($\beta$) and the basic reproductive ratio (R0) of an infectious pathogen, which contains a mixture of demographic and epidemiological parameters. The analytic results are compared with a simulation and are shown to give good agreement. The simulation permits the exploration of more realistic movement strategies and their consequent effect on epidemic dynamics.},

Wildlife, both native and introduced, can harbor and spread diseases of importance to the livestock industry. Describing movement patterns of such wildlife is essential to formulate effective disease management strategies. Nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are a free-ranging, introduced ungulate in southern Texas known to carry cattle fever ticks (CFT, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, R. (B.) annulatus). CFT are the vector for the etiological agent of bovine babesiosis, a lethal disease causing high mortality in susceptible Bos taurus populations and severely affecting the beef cattle industry. Efforts to eradicate CFT from the United States have been successful. However, a permanent quarantine area is maintained between Texas and Mexico to check its entry from infested areas of neighboring Mexico states on wildlife and stray cattle. In recent years, there has been an increase in CFT infestations outside of the permanent quarantine area in Texas. Nilgai are of interest in understanding how CFT may be spread through the landscape. Thirty nilgai of both sexes were captured and fitted with satellite radio collars in South Texas to gain information about movement patterns, response to disturbances, and movement barriers. Median annual home range sizes were highly variable in males (4665ha, range=571\textendash{}20,809) and females (1606ha, range=848\textendash{}29,909). Female movement patterns appeared to be seasonal with peaks during June-August; these peaks appeared to be a function of break-ups in female social groups rather than environmental conditions. Nilgai, which reportedly are sensitive to disturbance, were more likely to relocate into new areas immediately after being captured versus four other types of helicopter activities. Nilgai did not cross 1.25m high cattle fences parallel to paved highways but did cross other fence types. Results indicate that females have a higher chance of spreading CFT through the landscape than males, but spread of CFT may be mitigated via maintenance of cattle fences running parallel with paved highways. Our results highlight the importance of documenting species-specific behavior in wildlife-livestock interfaces that can be used to develop effective disease management strategies in the United States and worldwide.},

  abstract = {Spatial epidemiology is the study of spatial variation in disease risk or incidence. Several ecological processes can result in strong spatial patterns of such risk or incidence: for example, pathogen dispersal might be highly localized, vectors or reservoirs for pathogens might be spatially restricted, or susceptible hosts might be clumped. Here, we briefly describe approaches to spatial epidemiology that are spatially implicit, such as metapopulation models of disease transmission, and then focus on research in spatial epidemiology that is spatially explicit, such as the creation of risk maps for particular geographical areas. Although the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases are the subject of intensive study, the impacts of landscape structure on epidemiological processes have so far been neglected. The few studies that demonstrate how landscape composition (types of elements) and configuration (spatial positions of those elements) influence disease risk or incidence suggest that a true integration of landscape ecology with epidemiology will be fruitful.},

  abstract = {A key question in clarifying human\textendash{}environment interactions is how dynamic complexity develops across integrative scales from molecular to population and global levels. Apart from its public health importance, measles is an excellent test bed for such an analysis. Simple mechanistic models have successfully illuminated measles dynamics at the city and country levels, revealing seasonal forcing of transmission as a major driver of long-term epidemic behavior. Seasonal forcing ties closely to patterns of school aggregation at the individual and community levels, but there are few explicit estimates of school transmission due to the relative lack of epidemic data at this scale. Here, we use data from a 1904 measles outbreak in schools in Woolwich, London, coupled with a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to analyze measles incidence data. Our results indicate that transmission within schools and age classes is higher than previous population-level serological data would suggest. This analysis sheds quantitative light on the role of school-aged children in measles cross-scale dynamics, as we illustrate with references to the contemporary vaccination landscape.},

  abstract = {Spatial heterogeneities and spatial separation of hosts are often seen as key factors when developing accurate predictive models of the spread of pathogens. The question we address in this paper is how coarse the resolution of the spatial data can be for a model to be a useful tool for informing control policies. We examine this problem using the specific case of foot-and-mouth disease spreading between farms using the formulation developed during the 2001 epidemic in the United Kingdom. We show that, if our model is carefully parameterized to match epidemic behavior, then using aggregate county-scale data from the United States is sufficient to closely determine optimal control measures (specifically ring culling). This result also holds when the approach is extended to theoretical distributions of farms where the spatial clustering can be manipulated to extremes. We have therefore shown that, although spatial structure can be critically important in allowing us to predict the emergent population-scale behavior from a knowledge of the individual-level dynamics, for this specific applied question, such structure is mostly subsumed in the parameterization allowing us to make policy predictions in the absence of high-quality spatial information. We believe that this approach will be of considerable benefit across a range of disciplines where data are only available at intermediate spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Humans are altering biodiversity globally and infectious diseases are on the rise; thus, there is interest in understanding how changes to biodiversity affect disease. Here, we explore how predator diversity shapes parasite transmission. In a mesocosm experiment that manipulated predator (larval dragonflies and damselflies) density and diversity, non-intraguild (non-IG) predators that only consume free-living cercariae (parasitic trematodes) reduced metacercarial infections in tadpoles, whereas intraguild (IG) predators that consume both parasites and tadpole hosts did not. This likely occurred because IG predators reduced tadpole densities and anticercarial behaviors, increasing per capita exposure rates of the surviving tadpoles (i.e., via density- and trait-mediated effects) despite the consumption of parasites. A mathematical model demonstrated that non-IG predators reduce macroparasite infections, but IG predation weakens this ``dilution effect'' and can even amplify parasite burdens. Consistent with the experiment and model, a wetland survey revealed that the diversity of IG predators was unrelated to metacercarial burdens in amphibians, but the diversity of non-IG predators was negatively correlated with infections. These results are strikingly similar to generalities that have emerged from the predator diversity\textendash{}pest biocontrol literature, suggesting that there may be general mechanisms for pest control and that biocontrol research might inform disease management and vice versa. In summary, we identified a general trait of predators\textemdash{}where they fall on an IG predation continuum\textemdash{}that predicts their ability to reduce infections and possibly pests in general. Consequently, managing assemblages of predators represents an underused tool for the management of human and wildlife diseases and pest populations.},

  abstract = {Among the realistic ingredients to be considered in the computational modeling of infectious diseases, human mobility represents a crucial challenge both on the theoretical side and in view of the limited availability of empirical data. To study the interplay between short-scale commuting flows and long-range airline traffic in shaping the spatiotemporal pattern of a global epidemic we (i) analyze mobility data from 29 countries around the world and find a gravity model able to provide a global description of commuting patterns up to 300 kms and (ii) integrate in a worldwide-structured metapopulation epidemic model a timescale-separation technique for evaluating the force of infection due to multiscale mobility processes in the disease dynamics. Commuting flows are found, on average, to be one order of magnitude larger than airline flows. However, their introduction into the worldwide model shows that the large-scale pattern of the simulated epidemic exhibits only small variations with respect to the baseline case where only airline traffic is considered. The presence of short-range mobility increases, however, the synchronization of subpopulations in close proximity and affects the epidemic behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure. The present approach outlines the possibility for the definition of layered computational approaches where different modeling assumptions and granularities can be used consistently in a unifying multiscale framework.},

  abstract = {Infectious diseases affect people, domestic animals and wildlife alike, with many pathogens being able to infect multiple species. Fifty years ago, following the wide-scale manufacture and use of antibiotics and vaccines, it seemed that the battle against infections was being won for the human population. Since then, however, and in addition to increasing antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens, there has been an increase in the emergence of, mostly viral, zoonotic diseases from wildlife, sometimes causing fatal outbreaks of epidemic proportions. Concurrently, infectious disease has been identified as an increasing threat to wildlife conservation. A synthesis published in 2000 showed common anthropogenic drivers of disease threats to biodiversity and human health, including encroachment and destruction of wildlife habitat and the human-assisted spread of pathogens. Almost two decades later, the situation has not changed and, despite improved knowledge of the underlying causes, little has been done at the policy level to address these threats. For the sake of public health and wellbeing, human-kind needs to work better to conserve nature and preserve the ecosystem services, including disease regulation, that biodiversity provides while also understanding and mitigating activities which lead to disease emergence. We consider that holistic, One Health approaches to the management and mitigation of the risks of emerging infectious diseases have the greatest chance of success.This article is part of the themed issue `One Health for a changing world: zoonoses, ecosystems and human well-being'.},

As anthropogenic climate change alters natural systems and global economic forces drive land-use and land-cover change, it becomes increasingly important to understand both the ecological and social factors that impact infectious disease outcomes for human populations. While the field of disease ecology explicitly studies the ecological aspects of infectious disease transmission, the effects of the social context on zoonotic pathogen spillover and subsequent human-to-human transmission are comparatively neglected in the literature. The social sciences encompass a variety of disciplines and frameworks for understanding infectious diseases; however, here we focus on four primary areas of social systems that quantitatively and qualitatively contribute to infectious diseases as social\textendash{}ecological systems. These areas are social mixing and structure, space and mobility, geography and environmental impact, and behaviour and behaviour change. Incorporation of these social factors requires empirical studies for parametrization, phenomena characterization and integrated theoretical modelling of social\textendash{}ecological interactions. The social\textendash{}ecological system that dictates infectious disease dynamics is a complex system rich in interacting variables with dynamically significant heterogeneous properties. Future discussions about infectious disease spillover and transmission in human populations need to address the social context that affects particular disease systems by identifying and measuring qualitatively important drivers.This article is part of the themed issue `Opening the black box: re-examining the ecology and evolution of parasite transmission'.},

Although there has been extensive work on the ecology and epidemiology of this disease in both Europe and North America, substantial uncertainty exists about fundamental aspects that determine spatial and temporal variation in both disease risk and human incidence, which hamper effective and efficient prevention and control. Here we describe areas of consensus that can be built on, identify areas of uncertainty and outline research needed to fill these gaps to facilitate predictive models of disease risk and the development of novel disease control strategies. Key areas of uncertainty include: (i) the precise influence of deer abundance on tick abundance, (ii) how tick populations are regulated, (iii) assembly of host communities and tick-feeding patterns across different habitats, (iv) reservoir competence of host species, and (v) pathogenicity for humans of different genotypes of Borrelia burgdorferi.

  volume = {23},
  issn = {10510761},
  abstract = {The process of disease transmission is determined by the interaction of host susceptibility and exposure to parasite infectious stages. Host behavior is an important determinant of the likelihood of exposure to infectious stages but is difficult to measure and often assumed to be homogenous in models of disease spread. We evaluated the importance of precisely defining host contact when using networks that estimate exposure and predict infection prevalence in a replicated, empirical system. In particular, we hypothesized that infection patterns would be predicted only by a contact network that is defined according to host behavior and parasite life cycle. Two competing host contact criteria were used to construct networks defined by parasite life cycle and social contacts. First, parasite-defined contacts were based on shared space with a time delay corresponding to the environmental development time of nematode parasites with a direct fecal\&\#x2014;oral life cycle. Second, social contacts were defined by shared space in the same time period. To quantify the competing networks of exposure and infection, we sampled natural populations of the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) and infection of their gastrointestinal helminth community using replicated longitudinal capture\&\#x2014;mark\&\#x2014;recapture techniques. We predicted that (1) infection with parasites with direct fecal\&\#x2014;oral life cycles would be explained by the time delay contact network, but not the social contact network; (2) infection with parasites with trophic life cycles (via a mobile intermediate host; thus, spatially decoupling transmission from host contact) would not be explained by either contact network. The prevalence of fecal\&\#x2014;oral life cycle nematode parasites was strongly correlated to the number and strength of network connections from the parasite-defined network (including the time delay), while the prevalence of trophic life cycle parasites was not correlated with any network metrics. We concluded that incorporating the parasite life cycle, relative to the way that exposure is measured, is key to inferring transmission and can be empirically quantified using network techniques. In addition, appropriately defining and measuring contacts according the life history of the parasite and relevant behaviors of the host is a crucial step in applying network analyses to empirical systems.},

Animal social networks are descriptions of social structure which, aside from their intrinsic interest for understanding sociality, can have significant bearing across many fields of biology.

*
Network analysis provides a flexible toolbox for testing a broad range of hypotheses, and for describing the social system of species or populations in a quantitative and comparable manner. However, it requires careful consideration of underlying assumptions, in particular differentiating real from observed networks and controlling for inherent biases that are common in social data.

*
We provide a practical guide for using this framework to analyse animal social systems and test hypotheses. First, we discuss key considerations when defining nodes and edges, and when designing methods for collecting data. We discuss different approaches for inferring social networks from these data and displaying them. We then provide an overview of methods for quantifying properties of nodes and networks, as well as for testing hypotheses concerning network structure and network processes. Finally, we provide information about assessing the power and accuracy of an observed network.

*
Alongside this manuscript, we provide appendices containing background information on common programming routines and worked examples of how to perform network analysis using the r programming language.

We conclude by discussing some of the major current challenges in social network analysis and interesting future directions. In particular, we highlight the under-exploited potential of experimental manipulations on social networks to address research questions.},

Although disease hosts are classically assumed to interact randomly [1], infection is likely to spread across structured and dynamic contact networks [2]. We used social network analyses to investigate contact patterns of group-living European badgers, Meles meles, which are an important wildlife reservoir of bovine tuberculosis (TB). We found that TB test-positive badgers were socially isolated from their own groups but were more important for flow, potentially of infection, between social groups. The distinctive social position of infected badgers may help explain how social stability mitigates, and social perturbation increases, the spread of infection in badgers.},

We identify four main obstacles to developing proactive management strategies for the newly discovered salamander pathogen Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). Given that uncertainty is a hallmark of wildlife disease management and that associated decisions are often complicated by multiple competing objectives, we advocate using decision analysis to create and evaluate trade-offs between proactive (pre-emergence) and reactive (post-emergence) management options.

  abstract = {* Infectious disease transmission often depends on the contact structure of host populations. Although it is often challenging to capture the contact structure in wild animals, new technology has enabled biologists to obtain detailed temporal information on wildlife social contacts. In this study, we investigated the effects of raccoon contact patterns on rabies spread using network modelling.

* Raccoons (Procyon lotor) play an important role in the maintenance of rabies in the United States. It is crucial to understand how contact patterns influence the spread of rabies in raccoon populations in order to design effective control measures and to prevent transmission to human populations and other animals.

* We constructed a dynamic system of contact networks based on empirical data from proximity logging collars on a wild suburban raccoon population and then simulated rabies spread across these networks. Our contact networks incorporated the number and duration of raccoon interactions. We included differences in contacts according to sex and season, and both short-term acquaintances and long-term associations. Raccoons may display different behaviours when infectious, including aggression (furious behaviour) and impaired mobility (dumb behaviour); the network model was used to assess the impact of potential behavioural changes in rabid raccoons. We also tested the effectiveness of different vaccination coverage levels.

* Our results demonstrate that when rabies enters a suburban raccoon population, the likelihood of a disease outbreak affecting the majority of the population is high. Both the magnitude of rabies outbreaks and the speed of rabies spread depend strongly on the time of year that rabies is introduced into the population. When there is a combination of dumb and furious behaviours in the rabid raccoon population, there are similar outbreak sizes and speed of spread to when there are no behavioural changes due to rabies infection.

* By incorporating detailed data describing the variation in raccoon contact rates into a network modelling approach, we were able to show that suburban raccoon populations are highly susceptible to rabies outbreaks, that the risk of large outbreaks varies seasonally and that current vaccination target levels may be inadequate to prevent the spread of rabies within these populations. Our findings provide new insights into rabies dynamics in raccoon populations and have important implications for disease control.},

  abstract = {* Long-term individual-based datasets on host\textendash{}pathogen systems are a rare and valuable resource for understanding the infectious disease dynamics in wildlife. A study of European badgers (Meles meles) naturally infected with bovine tuberculosis (bTB) at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire (UK) has produced a unique dataset, facilitating investigation of a diverse range of epidemiological and ecological questions with implications for disease management.

* Since the 1970s, this badger population has been monitored with a systematic mark\textendash{}recapture regime yielding a dataset of $>$15,000 captures of $>$3,000 individuals, providing detailed individual life-history, morphometric, genetic, reproductive and disease data.

* The annual prevalence of bTB in the Woodchester Park badger population exhibits no straightforward relationship with population density, and both the incidence and prevalence of Mycobacterium bovis show marked variation in space. The study has revealed phenotypic traits that are critical for understanding the social structure of badger populations along with mechanisms vital for understanding disease spread at different spatial resolutions.

* Woodchester-based studies have provided key insights into how host ecology can influence infection at different spatial and temporal scales. Specifically, it has revealed heterogeneity in epidemiological parameters; intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting population dynamics; provided insights into senescence and individual life histories; and revealed consistent individual variation in foraging patterns, refuge use and social interactions.

* An improved understanding of ecological and epidemiological processes is imperative for effective disease management. Woodchester Park research has provided information of direct relevance to bTB management, and a better appreciation of the role of individual heterogeneity in disease transmission can contribute further in this regard.

* The Woodchester Park study system now offers a rare opportunity to seek a dynamic understanding of how individual-, group- and population-level processes interact. The wealth of existing data makes it possible to take a more integrative approach to examining how the consequences of individual heterogeneity scale to determine population-level pathogen dynamics and help advance our understanding of the ecological drivers of host\textendash{}pathogen systems.},

  title = {When to Choose Dynamic vs. Static Social Network Analysis},
  issn = {1365-2656},
  doi = {10.1111/1365-2656.12764},
  abstract = {* There is increasing interest in using dynamic social networks in the study of animal sociality and its consequences. However, there is a general lack of guidance on the when and how such an approach will be valuable.

* The aim of this paper is to provide a guide on when to choose dynamic vs. static social network analysis, and how to choose the appropriate temporal scale for the dynamic network.

* I first discuss the motivations for using dynamic animal social networks. I then provide guidance on how to choose between dynamic networks and the ``standard'' approach of using static networks. I discuss this in the context of the temporal scale of changes observed, of their predictability and of the data availability.

* Dynamic networks are important in a number of scenarios. First, if the network data are being compared to independent processes, such as the spread of information or disease or environmental changes, then dynamic networks will provide more accurate estimates of spreading rates. Second, if the network has predictable patterns of change, for example diel cycles or seasonal changes, then dynamic networks should be used to capture the impact of these changes. Third, dynamic networks are important for studies of spread through networks when the relationship between edge weight and transmission probability is nonlinear. Finally, dynamic social networks are also useful in situations where interactions among individuals are dense, such as in studies of captive groups.

* The use of static vs. dynamic network requires careful consideration, both from a research question perspective and from a data perspective, and this paper provides a guide on how to evaluate the relative importance of these.},

  abstract = {* Host social structure is fundamental to how infections spread and persist, and so the statistical modelling of static and dynamic social networks provides an invaluable tool to parameterise realistic epidemiological models.

* We present a practical guide to the application of network modelling frameworks for hypothesis testing related to social interactions and epidemiology, illustrating some approaches with worked examples using data from a population of wild European badgers Meles meles naturally infected with bovine tuberculosis.

* Different empirical network datasets generate particular statistical issues related to non-independence and sampling constraints. We therefore discuss the strengths and weaknesses of modelling approaches for different types of network data and for answering different questions relating to disease transmission.

* We argue that statistical modelling frameworks designed specifically for network analysis offer great potential in directly relating network structure to infection. They have the potential to be powerful tools in analysing empirical contact data used in epidemiological studies, but remain untested for use in networks of spatio-temporal associations.

* As a result, we argue that developments in the statistical analysis of empirical contact data are critical given the ready availability of dynamic network data from bio-logging studies. Furthermore, we encourage improved integration of statistical network approaches into epidemiological research to facilitate the generation of novel modelling frameworks and help extend our understanding of disease transmission in natural populations.},

  abstract = {Understanding the circumstances under which exposure to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) leads to infection is important for managing risks to public health. Based upon ideas in toxicology and radiology, it is plausible that exposure to harmful agents, including TSEs, is completely safe if the dose is low enough. However, the existence of a threshold, below which infection probability is zero has never been demonstrated experimentally. Here we explore this question by combining data and mathematical models that describe scrapie infections in mice following experimental challenge over a broad range of doses. We analyse data from 4338 mice inoculated at doses ranging over ten orders of magnitude. These data are compared to results from a within-host model in which prions accumulate according to a stochastic birth-death process. Crucially, this model assumes no threshold on the dose required for infection. Our data reveal that infection is possible at the very low dose of a 1000 fold dilution of the dose that infects half the challenged animals (ID50). Furthermore, the dose response curve closely matches that predicted by the model. These findings imply that there is no safe dose of prions and that assessments of the risk from low dose exposure are right to assume a linear relationship between dose and probability of infection. We also refine two common perceptions about TSE incubation periods: that their mean values decrease linearly with logarithmic decreases in dose and that they are highly reproducible between hosts. The model and data both show that the linear decrease in incubation period holds only for doses above the ID50. Furthermore, variability in incubation periods is greater than predicted by the model, not smaller. This result poses new questions about the sources of variability in prion incubation periods. It also provides insight into the limitations of the incubation period assay.},

Our Monte Carlo simulation results indicate superior model performance for the new modeling framework, evidenced by lower bias and proper confidence interval coverage.

  volume = {11},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0163592},
  abstract = {White-tailed deer are a culturally and economically important game species in North America, especially in South Texas. The recent discovery of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in captive deer facilities in Texas has increased concern about the potential emergence of CWD in free-ranging deer. The concern is exacerbated because much of the South Texas region is a semi-arid environment with variable rainfall, where precipitation is strongly correlated with fawn recruitment. Further, the marginally productive rangelands, in combination with erratic fawn recruitment, results in populations that are frequently density-independent, and thus sensitive to additive mortality. It is unknown how a deer population in semi-arid regions would respond to the presence of CWD. We used long-term empirical datasets from a lightly harvested (2\% annual harvest) population in conjunction with 3 prevalence growth rates from CWD afflicted areas (0.26\%, 0.83\%, and 2.3\% increases per year) via a multi-stage partially deterministic model to simulate a deer population for 25 years under four scenarios: 1) without CWD and without harvest, 2) with CWD and without harvest, 3) with CWD and male harvest only, and 4) with CWD and harvest of both sexes. The modeled populations without CWD and without harvest averaged a 1.43\% annual increase over 25 years; incorporation of 2\% annual harvest of both sexes resulted in a stable population. The model with slowest CWD prevalence rate growth (0.26\% annually) without harvest resulted in stable populations but the addition of 1\% harvest resulted in population declines. Further, the male age structure in CWD models became skewed to younger age classes. We incorporated fawn:doe ratios from three CWD afflicted areas in Wisconsin and Wyoming into the model with 0.26\% annual increase in prevalence and populations did not begin to decline until \textasciitilde{}10\%, \textasciitilde{}16\%, and \textasciitilde{}26\% of deer were harvested annually. Deer populations in variable environments rely on high adult survivorship to buffer the low and erratic fawn recruitment rates. The increase in additive mortality rates for adults via CWD negatively impacted simulated population trends to the extent that hunter opportunity would be greatly reduced. Our results improve understanding of the potential influences of CWD on deer populations in semi-arid environments with implications for deer managers, disease ecologists, and policy makers.},

  volume = {80},
  issn = {00129615},
  abstract = {Underlying dynamic event processes unfolding in continuous time give rise to spatiotemporal patterns that are sometimes observable at only a few discrete times. Such event processes may be modulated simultaneously over several spatial (e.g., latitude and longitude) and temporal (e.g., age, calendar time, and cohort) dimensions. The ecological challenge is to understand the dynamic latent processes that were integrated over several dimensions (space and time) to produce the observed pattern: a so-called inverse problem. An example of such a problem is characterizing epidemiological rate processes from spatially referenced age-specific prevalence data for a wildlife disease such as chronic wasting disease (CWD). With age-specific prevalence data, the exact infection times are not observed, which complicates the direct estimation of rates. However, the relationship between the observed data and the unobserved rate variables can be described with likelihood equations. Typically, for problems with multiple timescales, the likelihoods are integral equations without closed forms. The complexity of the likelihoods often makes traditional maximum-likelihood approaches untenable. Here, using seven years of hunter-harvest prevalence data from the CWD epidemic in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Wisconsin, USA, we develop and explore a Bayesian approach that allows for a detailed examination of factors modulating the infection rates over space, age, and time, and their interactions. Our approach relies on the Bayesian ability to borrow strength from neighbors in both space and time. Synthesizing a number of areas of event time analysis (current-status data, age/period/cohort models, Bayesian spatial shared frailty models), our general framework has very broad ecological applicability beyond disease prevalence data to a number of important ecological event time analyses, including general survival studies with multiple time dimensions for which existing methodology is limited. We observed strong associations of infection rates with age, gender, and location. The infection rate appears to be increasing with time. We could not detect growth hotspots, or location by time interactions, which suggests that spatial variation in infection rates is determined primarily by when the disease arrives locally, rather than how fast it grows. We emphasize assumptions and the potential consequences of their violations.},

To propel the field of animal social networks beyond exploratory analyses and to facilitate the integration of quantitative methods that allow for the testing of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant hypotheses, we review methodological and conceptual advances in network science, which are underutilized in studies of animal sociality. First, we highlight how the use of statistical modeling and triadic motifs analysis can advance our understanding of the processes that structure networks. Second, we discuss how the consideration of temporal changes and spatial constraints can shed light on the dynamics of social networks. Third, we consider how the study of variation at multiple scales can potentially transform our understanding of the structure and function of animal networks. We direct readers to analytical tools that facilitate the adoption of these new concepts and methods.

They inflict major economic losses in forestry, agriculture, and transportation and contribute to the transmission of several animal and human diseases. Their impact on natural ecosystems is also dramatic but less quantified. By foraging selectively, deer affect the growth and survival of many herb, shrub, and tree species, modifying patterns of relative abundance and vegetation dynamics. Cascading effects on other species extend to insects, birds, and other mammals. In forests, sustained overbrowsing reduces plant cover and diversity, alters nutrient and carbon cycling, and redirects succession to shift future overstory composition. Many of these simplified alternative states appear to be stable and difficult to reverse. Given the influence of deer on other organisms and natural processes, ecologists should actively participate in efforts to understand, monitor, and reduce the impact of deer on ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Previous human dimension research has reported negative perceptions among hunters toward Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) and disease-related regulations that may limit hunter participation, reduce harvest, and generally complicate management. During 2013, we surveyed 1,524 Maryland, USA, deer (Odocoileus spp.) hunters from 3 counties of varying proximity to the Chronic Wasting Disease Management Area (CWDMA) regarding hunter behavioral changes due to CWD. We linked responses to each individual's harvest history to examine hunter retention, potential harvest reduction related to CWD presence and management, and degree to which distance from the disease affected behavior. Overall, 1.1\% of respondents claimed to have stopped hunting because of CWD; however, 47.1\% of those respondents continued to register deer after disease discovery, resulting in a true decrease in retention of no $>$0.6\%. In the county containing the CWDMA, we observed the greatest percentage of negative perception (22.6\%) and greatest reduction in harvest reportedly related to CWD (7.0\%). In an adjacent county west of the CWDMA, we observed fewer negative perceptions (16.8\%) and no reduction in harvest in response to disease discovery. Similar negative perceptions were reported in the county 200\,km southeast of the CWDMA (14.1\%), but also resulted in no reduction in harvest. Negative hunter perceptions did not seem to be directly related with hunter behavior. Behavioral shifts due to CWD were localized at the county scale and had less impact on annual harvest than normal year-to-year stochastic variability. Upon initial detection of CWD, we recommend implementing necessary protocols for disease management with the understanding that hunter perceptions may have negligible impact on harvest management. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {New methods for modeling animal movement based on telemetry data are developed regularly. With advances in telemetry capabilities, animal movement models are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite a need for population-level inference, animal movement models are still predominantly developed for individual-level inference. Most efforts to upscale the inference to the population level are either post hoc or complicated enough that only the developer can implement the model. Hierarchical Bayesian models provide an ideal platform for the development of population-level animal movement models but can be challenging to fit due to computational limitations or extensive tuning required. We propose a two-stage procedure for fitting hierarchical animal movement models to telemetry data. The two-stage approach is statistically rigorous and allows one to fit individual-level movement models separately, then resample them using a secondary MCMC algorithm. The primary advantages of the two-stage approach are that the first stage is easily parallelizable and the second stage is completely unsupervised, allowing for an automated fitting procedure in many cases. We demonstrate the two-stage procedure with two applications of animal movement models. The first application involves a spatial point process approach to modeling telemetry data, and the second involves a more complicated continuous-time discrete-space animal movement model. We fit these models to simulated data and real telemetry data arising from a population of monitored Canada lynx in Colorado, USA. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In the light of this emerging issue, the European Commission requested EFSA to recommend surveillance activities and, if necessary, additional animal health risk-based measures to prevent the introduction of the disease and the spread into/within the EU, specifically Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden, and considering seven wild, semidomesticated and farmed cervid species (Eurasian tundra reindeer, Finnish (Eurasian) forest reindeer, moose, roe deer, white-tailed deer, red deer and fallow deer). It was also asked to assess any new evidence on possible public health risks related to CWD. A 3-year surveillance system is proposed, differing for farmed and wild or semidomesticated cervids, with a two-stage sampling programme at the farm/geographically based population unit level (random sampling) and individual level (convenience sampling targeting high-risk animals). The current derogations of Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1918 present a risk of introduction of CWD into the EU. Measures to prevent the spread of CWD within the EU are dependent upon the assumption that the disease is already present; this is currently unknown. The measures listed are intended to contain (limit the geographic extent of a focus) and/or to control (actively stabilise/reduce infection rates in an affected herd or population) the disease where it occurs. With regard to the zoonotic potential, the human species barrier for CWD prions does not appear to be absolute. These prions are present in the skeletal muscle and other edible tissues, so humans may consume infected material in enzootic areas.

Mean response time was 53.3\,hr, but ranged from 0.3\,hr to 579\,hr, depending on collar accessibility and proper functioning of the GPS component. We censored capture-related mortalities and slipped collars. Twenty-five of 34 calves (74\%) died of natural causes as of 31 December 2013, including 1 after natural abandonment, 1 after abandonment of unknown cause, 1 drowning, 1 unknown predator kill, 1 lethal infection from wolf (Canis lupus) bites, 4 black bear (Ursus americanus) kills, 12 wolf kills, and 4 ``probable wolf kills.'' As this technology develops, the quantity and quality of survival, cause-specific mortality, movement, and habitat use data generated from intense monitoring of GPS-collared adults and offspring will have unprecedented value associated with management at the population and landscape scales. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Data were obtained from surveys of 2,725 deer and elk hunters in Colorado. Cluster analysis grouped hunters into no (42\%), slight (44\%), and moderate (14\%) risk groups based on perceptions of personal health risks from CWD (e.g., concern about health, become ill from CWD). There were minimal differences among groups in demographics, information sources, and knowledge about CWD. Hunters who perceived higher health risks from CWD (i.e., moderate risk), however, perceived greater risks associated with CWD to other humans, CWD to wildlife, hunting to personal health, other diseases to health, and the future of hunting. These findings illustrated the concept of risk sensitivity where hunters who perceived higher risks from CWD were predisposed to rate all other risks as large.},

  abstract = {An effective live animal diagnostic test is needed to assist in the control of chronic wasting disease (CWD), which has spread through captive and wild herds of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Canada and the United States. In the present study, the diagnostic accuracy of rectal mucosa biopsy sample testing was determined in white-tailed deer from 4 CWD-infected captive herds. Specifically, the current study compared the immunohistochemical detection of disease-associated prion protein in postmortem rectal mucosa biopsy samples to the CWD status of each deer as determined by immunodiagnostic evaluations of the brainstem at the obex, the medial retropharyngeal lymph node, and the palatine tonsil. The effects of age, sex, genotype, and disease progression were also evaluated. Diagnostic sensitivity on rectal biopsy samples for CWD in white-tailed deer ranged from 63\% to 100\%; the pooled estimate of sensitivity was 68\% with 95\% confidence limits (95\% CLs) of 49\% and 82\%. However, diagnostic sensitivity was dependent on genotype at prion protein gene (PRNP) codon 96 and on disease progression as assessed by obex grade. Diagnostic sensitivity was 76\% (95\% CLs: 49\%, 91\%) for 96GG deer but only 42\% (95\% CLs: 13\%, 79\%) for 96GS deer. Furthermore, diagnostic sensitivity was only 36\% for deer in the earliest stage of disease (obex grade 0) but was 100\% for deer in the last 2 stages of preclinical disease (obex grades 3 and 4). The overall diagnostic specificity was 99.8\%. Selective use of antemortem rectal biopsy sample testing would provide valuable information during disease investigations of CWD-suspect deer herds.},

  abstract = {Natal features (e.g. Julian birth date and birth mass) often have fitness consequences and can be influenced by endogenous responses by the mother to seasonal fluctuations in nutritional quality and photoperiodic cues. We sought to further understand the biological and environmental factors that influence the natal features of a polytocous species in an environment with constant nutritional resources and limited seasonal variation. During a 36-year study we assessed the influence of biological factors (maternal age and litter type [i.e., litter size and sexual composition]) and environmental factors (total precipitation and mean maximum temperature during months encompassing conception, the last trimester of gestation, and the entire length of gestation) on Julian birth date and birth mass using linear-mixed effects models. Linear and quadratic functions of maternal age influenced both natal features with earliest Julian birth dates and heaviest birth masses occurring at prime-age and older individuals, which ranged from 5\textendash{}9 years of age. Litter type influenced Julian birth date and birth mass. Interestingly, environmental factors affected Julian birth date and birth mass even though mothers were continuously allowed access to a high-quality diet. Random effects revealed considerable variation among mothers and years. This study demonstrates that, in long-lived polytocous species, environmental factors may have a greater influence on natal features than previously supposed and the influence from biological factors is also complex. The documented responses to environmental influences provide unique insights into how mammalian seasonal reproductive dynamics may respond to current changes in climate.},

  abstract = {Population abundance data vary widely in quality and are rarely accurate. The two main components of error in such data are observation and process error. We used Bayesian state space models to estimate the observation and process error in time-series of 55 globally distributed populations of two species, Cervus elaphus (elk/red deer) and Rangifer tarandus (caribou/reindeer). We examined variation among populations and species in the magnitude of estimates of error components and density dependence using generalized linear models. Process error exceeded observation error in 75\% of all populations, and on average, both components of error were greater in Rangifer than in Cervus populations. Observation error differed significantly across the different observation methods, and predation and time-series length differentially affected the error components. Comparing the Bayesian model results to traditional models that do not separate error components revealed the potential for misleading inferences about sources of variation in population dynamics.

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of demographic parameters are required to infer appropriate ecological relationships and inform management actions. Known-fate data from marked individuals are commonly used to estimate survival rates, whereas N-mixture models use count data from unmarked individuals to estimate multiple demographic parameters. However, a joint approach combining the strengths of both analytical tools has not been developed. Here we develop an integrated model combining known-fate and open N-mixture models, allowing the estimation of detection probability, recruitment, and the joint estimation of survival. We demonstrate our approach through both simulations and an applied example using four years of known-fate and pack count data for wolves (Canis lupus). Simulation results indicated that the integrated model reliably recovered parameters with no evidence of bias, and survival estimates were more precise under the joint model. Results from the applied example indicated that the marked sample of wolves was biased toward individuals with higher apparent survival rates than the unmarked pack mates, suggesting that joint estimates may be more representative of the overall population. Our integrated model is a practical approach for reducing bias while increasing precision and the amount of information gained from mark\&\#x2013;resight data sets. We provide implementations in both the BUGS language and an R package.},

  abstract = {The effects of harvest on the annual and seasonal survival of willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus L. were tested in a large-scale harvest experiment. Management units were randomly assigned to one of three experimental treatments: 0\%, 15\% or 30\% harvest. Seasonal quotas were based on the experimental treatment and estimates of bird density before the hunting season. Survival rates and hazard functions for radio-marked ptarmigan were then estimated under the competing risks of harvest and natural mortality. 2.\hspace{0.6em}The partially compensatory mortality hypothesis was supported: annual survival of ptarmigan was 0$\cdot$54~$\pm$~0$\cdot$08~SE under 0\% harvest, 0$\cdot$47~$\pm$~0$\cdot$06 under 15\% harvest, and was reduced to 0$\cdot$30~$\pm$~0$\cdot$05 under 30\% harvest. Harvest mortality increased linearly from 0$\cdot$08~$\pm$~0$\cdot$05, 0$\cdot$27~$\pm$ 0$\cdot$05 and 0$\cdot$42~$\pm$~0$\cdot$06 from 0\% to 30\% harvest, whereas natural mortality was 0$\cdot$38~$\pm$~0$\cdot$08, 0$\cdot$25~$\pm$~0$\cdot$05 and 0$\cdot$28~$\pm$~0$\cdot$06 under the same treatments. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Realized risk of harvest mortality was 0$\cdot$08-0$\cdot$12 points higher than our set harvest treatments of 0\textendash{}30\% because birds were exposed to risk if they moved out of protected areas. The superadditive hypothesis was supported because birds in the 30\% harvest treatment had higher natural mortality during winter after the hunting season. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Natural mortality was mainly because of raptor predation, with two seasonal peaks in fall and spring. Natural and harvest mortality coincided during early autumn with little potential for compensation during winter months. Peak risk of harvest mortality was 5\texttimes{} higher than natural mortality. Low natural mortality during winter suggests that most late season harvest would be additive mortality. 5.\hspace{0.6em}Environmental correlates of natural mortality of ptarmigan included seasonal changes in snow cover, onset of juvenile dispersal, and periods of territorial activity. Natural mortality of ptarmigan was highest during autumn movements and nesting by gyrfalcons Falco rusticolus L. Mortality was low when gyrfalcons had departed for coastal wintering sites, and during summer when ptarmigan were attending nests and broods. 6.\hspace{0.6em}Our experimental results have important implications for harvest management of upland gamebirds. Seasonal quotas based on proportional harvest were effective and should be set at $\leq$15\% of August populations for regional management plans. Under threshold harvest of a reproductive surplus, 15\% harvest would be sustainable at productivity rates $\geq$2$\cdot$5 young per pair. Impacts of winter harvest could be minimized by closing the hunting season in early November or by reducing late season quotas.},

We review the primary theoretical mechanisms that allow disease-induced extinction and compare them with the empirical literature on parasitic threats to populations to assess the importance of different mechanisms in threatening natural populations.

However, traditional statistical approaches used to conduct quantitative analysis have thus far had limited success in revealing underlying mechanisms driving activity patterns. Here, we combine wavelet analysis, a type of frequency-based time-series analysis, with high-resolution activity data from accelerometers embedded in GPS collars to explore the effects of internal states (e.g., pregnancy) and external factors (e.g., seasonal dynamics of resources and weather) on activity patterns of the endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Giant pandas exhibited higher frequency cycles during the winter when resources (e.g., water and forage) were relatively poor, as well as during spring, which includes the giant panda's mating season. During the summer and autumn when resources were abundant, pandas exhibited a regular activity pattern with activity peaks every 24~hr. A pregnant individual showed distinct differences in her activity pattern from other giant pandas for several months following parturition. These results indicate that animals adjust activity cycles to adapt to seasonal variation of the resources and unique physiological periods. Wavelet coherency analysis also verified the synchronization of giant panda activity level with air temperature and solar radiation at the 24-hr band. Our study also shows that wavelet analysis is an effective tool for analyzing high-resolution activity pattern data and its relationship to internal and external states, an approach that has the potential to inform wildlife conservation and management across species.},

The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a `mixing network'. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks\textemdash{}and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm\textemdash{}have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures.Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.},

  abstract = {Understanding the emergence and subsequent spread of human infectious diseases is a critical global challenge, especially for high-impact zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. Global climate and land-use change are likely to alter host and vector distributions, but understanding the impact of these changes on the burden of infectious diseases is difficult. Here, we use a Bayesian spatial model to investigate environmental drivers of one of the most important diseases in Africa, Rift Valley fever (RVF). The model uses a hierarchical approach to determine how environmental drivers vary both spatially and seasonally, and incorporates the effects of key climatic oscillations, to produce a continental risk map of RVF in livestock (as a proxy for human RVF risk). We find RVF risk has a distinct seasonal spatial pattern influenced by climatic variation, with the majority of cases occurring in South Africa and Kenya in the first half of an El Ni\~no year. Irrigation, rainfall and human population density were the main drivers of RVF cases, independent of seasonal, climatic or spatial variation. By accounting more subtly for the patterns in RVF data, we better determine the importance of underlying environmental drivers, and also make space- and time-sensitive predictions to better direct future surveillance resources.This article is part of the themed issue `One Health for a changing world: zoonoses, ecosystems and human well-being'.},

Transmission is the result of interacting host and pathogen processes, encapsulated with the environment in a `transmission triangle'. Multiple transmission modes and their epidemiological consequences are often not understood because the direct measurement of transmission is difficult. However, its different components can be analysed using nonlinear transmission functions, contact matrices and networks. A particular challenge is to develop such functions for spatially extended systems. This is illustrated for vector transmission where a `perception kernel' approach is developed that incorporates vector behaviour in response to host spacing. A major challenge is understanding the relative merits of the large number of approaches to quantifying transmission. The evolution of transmission mode itself has been a rather neglected topic, but is important in the context of understanding disease emergence and genetic variation in pathogens. Disease impacts many biological processes such as community stability, the evolution of sex and speciation, yet the importance of different transmission modes in these processes is not understood. Broader approaches and ideas to disease transmission are important in the public health realm for combating newly emerging infections.This article is part of the themed issue `Opening the black box: re-examining the ecology and evolution of parasite transmission'.},

We address this problem by applying a Support Vector Machine and a Hidden-Markov Model that allows us to classify an animal's behaviour using a small set of field observations to calibrate continuously recorded activity data. Such classified data can be applied quantitatively to the behaviour of animals over extended periods and at times during which observation is difficult or impossible. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method by applying it to data from six cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Cumulative activity data scores were recorded every five minutes by accelerometers embedded in GPS radio-collars for around one year on average. Direct behaviour sampling of each of the six cheetah were collected in the field for comparatively short periods. Using this approach we are able to classify each five minute activity score into a set of three key behaviour (feeding, mobile and stationary), creating a continuous behavioural sequence for the entire period for which the collars were deployed. Evaluation of our classifier with cross-validation shows the accuracy to be , but that the accuracy for individual classes is reduced with decreasing sample size of direct observations. We demonstrate how these processed data can be used to study behaviour identifying seasonal and gender differences in daily activity and feeding times. Results given here are unlike any that could be obtained using traditional approaches in both accuracy and detail.},

  issn = {00220302},
  abstract = {The objective of this study was to use automated activity, lying, and rumination monitors to characterize prepartum behavior and predict calving in dairy cattle. Data were collected from 20 primiparous and 33 multiparous Holstein dairy cattle from September 2011 to May 2013 at the University of Kentucky Coldstream Dairy. The HR Tag (SCR Engineers Ltd., Netanya, Israel) automatically collected neck activity and rumination data in 2-h increments. The IceQube (IceRobotics Ltd., South Queensferry, United Kingdom) automatically collected number of steps, lying time, standing time, number of transitions from standing to lying (lying bouts), and total motion, summed in 15-min increments. IceQube data were summed in 2-h increments to match HR Tag data. All behavioral data were collected for 14 d before the predicted calving date. Retrospective data analysis was performed using mixed linear models to examine behavioral changes by day in the 14 d before calving. Bihourly behavioral differences from baseline values over the 14 d before calving were also evaluated using mixed linear models. Changes in daily rumination time, total motion, lying time, and lying bouts occurred in the 14 d before calving. In the bihourly analysis, extreme values for all behaviors occurred in the final 24 h, indicating that the monitored behaviors may be useful in calving prediction. To determine whether technologies were useful at predicting calving, random forest, linear discriminant analysis, and neural network machine-learning techniques were constructed and implemented using R version 3.1.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). These methods were used on variables from each technology and all combined variables from both technologies. A neural network analysis that combined variables from both technologies at the daily level yielded 100.0\% sensitivity and 86.8\% specificity. A neural network analysis that combined variables from both technologies in bihourly increments was used to identify 2-h periods in the 8 h before calving with 82.8\% sensitivity and 80.4\% specificity. Changes in behavior and machine-learning alerts indicate that commercially marketed behavioral monitors may have calving prediction potential. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Conservation biologists face many challenges in assessing health, immune status and infectious diseases in protected species. These challenges include unpredictable sample populations, diverse genetic and environmental backgrounds of the animals, as well as the practical, legal and ethical issues involved in experimentation. The use of whole genome scale transcriptomics with animal samples obtained in a minimally invasive manner is an approach that shows promise for health assessment. In this study we assessed the utility of a microarray to identify changes in gene expression predictive of health status by interrogating blood samples from California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) in rehabilitation. A custom microarray was developed from the commercially available dog microarray (Canis familiaris) by selecting probes that demonstrated reliable cross-hybridization with RNA in sea lion blood. This custom microarray was used for the analysis of RNA from 73 sea lion blood samples, from animals with a broad spectrum of health changes. Both traditional classifying techniques and newer artificial neural network approaches correctly classified sea lions with respect to health status, primarily distinguishing between leptospirosis infection and domoic acid exposure. Real time PCR validation for a small set of genes, followed by sequencing, showed good correlation with array results and high identity (96\textendash{}98\%) between the dog and sea lion sequences. This approach to health status classification shows promise for disease identification in a clinical setting, and assessment of health status of wildlife.},

There is growing interest in the automatic detection of animals' behaviors and body postures within the field of Animal Computer Interaction, and the benefits this could bring to animal welfare, enabling remote communication, welfare assessment, detection of behavioral patterns, interactive and adaptive systems, etc. Most of the works on animals' behavior recognition rely on wearable sensors to gather information about the animals' postures and movements, which are then processed using machine learning techniques. However, non-wearable mechanisms such as depth-based tracking could also make use of machine learning techniques and classifiers for the automatic detection of animals' behavior. These systems also offer the advantage of working in set-ups in which wearable devices would be difficult to use. This paper presents a depth-based tracking system for the automatic detection of animals' postures and body parts, as well as an exhaustive evaluation on the performance of several classification algorithms based on both a supervised and a knowledge-based approach. The evaluation of the depth-based tracking system and the different classifiers shows that the system proposed is promising for advancing the research on animals' behavior recognition within and outside the field of Animal Computer Interaction.},

  volume = {12},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0178082},
  abstract = {In animal behaviour, there is a dichotomy between innate behaviours (e.g., temperament or personality traits) versus those behaviours shaped by learning. Innate personality traits are supposedly less evident in animals when confounded by learning acquired with experience through time. Learning might play a key role in the development and adoption of successful anti-predator strategies, and the related adaptation has the potential to make animals that are more experienced less vulnerable to predation. We carried out a study in a system involving a large herbivorous mammal, female elk, Cervus elaphus, and their primary predator, i.e., human hunters. Using fine-scale satellite telemetry relocations, we tested whether differences in behaviour depending on age were due solely to selection pressure imposed by human hunters, meaning that females that were more cautious were more likely to survive and become older. Or whether learning also was involved, meaning that females adjusted their behaviour as they aged. Our results indicated that both human selection and learning contributed to the adoption of more cautious behavioural strategies in older females. Whereas human selection of behavioural traits has been shown in our previous research, we here provide evidence of additive learning processes being responsible for shaping the behaviour of individuals in this population. Female elk are indeed almost invulnerable to human hunters when older than 9\textendash{}10 y.o., confirming that experience contributes to their survival. Female elk monitored in our study showed individually changing behaviours and clear adaptation as they aged, such as reduced movement rates (decreased likelihood of encountering human hunters), and increased use of secure areas (forest and steeper terrain), especially when close to roads. We also found that elk adjusted behaviours depending on the type of threat (bow and arrow vs. rifle hunters). This fine-tuning by elk to avoid hunters, rather than just becoming more cautious during the hunting season, highlights the behavioural plasticity of this species. Selection on behavioural traits and/or behavioural shifts via learning are an important but often-ignored consequence of human exploitation of wild animals. Such information is a critical component of the effects of human exploitation of wildlife populations with implications for improving their management and conservation.},

Historical and contemporary livestock production\textemdash{}the most widespread and long-running commercial use of public lands\textemdash{}can alter vegetation, soils, hydrology, and wildlife species composition and abundances in ways that exacerbate the effects of climate change on these resources. Excess abundance of native ungulates (e.g., deer or elk) and feral horses and burros add to these impacts. Although many of these consequences have been studied for decades, the ongoing and impending effects of ungulates in a changing climate require new management strategies for limiting their threats to the long-term supply of ecosystem services on public lands. Removing or reducing livestock across large areas of public land would alleviate a widely recognized and long-term stressor and make these lands less susceptible to the effects of climate change. Where livestock use continues, or where significant densities of wild or feral ungulates occur, management should carefully document the ecological, social, and economic consequences (both costs and benefits) to better ensure management that minimizes ungulate impacts to plant and animal communities, soils, and water resources. Reestablishing apex predators in large, contiguous areas of public land may help mitigate any adverse ecological effects of wild ungulates.},

  abstract = {In ungulates, parturition is correlated with a reduction in movement rate. With advances in movement-based technologies comes an opportunity to develop new techniques to assess reproduction in wild ungulates that are less invasive and reduce biases. DeMars et al. (2013, Ecology and Evolution 3:4149\textendash{}4160) proposed two promising new methods (individual- and population-based; the DeMars model) that use GPS inter-fix step length of adult female caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to infer parturition and neonate survival. Our objective was to apply the DeMars model to caribou populations that may violate model assumptions for retrospective analysis of parturition and calf survival. We extended the use of the DeMars model after assigning parturition and calf mortality status by examining herd-wide distributions of parturition date, calf mortality date, and survival. We used the DeMars model to estimate parturition and calf mortality events and compared them with the known parturition and calf mortality events from collared adult females (n = 19). We also used the DeMars model to estimate parturition and calf mortality events for collared female caribou with unknown parturition and calf mortality events (n = 43) and instead derived herd-wide estimates of calf survival as well as distributions of parturition and calf mortality dates and compared them to herd-wide estimates generated from calves fitted with VHF collars (n = 134). For our data, the individual-based method was effective at predicting calf mortality, but was not effective at predicting parturition. The population-based method was more effective at predicting parturition but was not effective at predicting calf mortality. At the herd-level, the predicted distributions of parturition date from both methods differed from each other and from the distribution derived from the parturition dates of VHF-collared calves (log-ranked test: $\chi$2 = 40.5, df = 2, p $<$ 0.01). The predicted distributions of calf mortality dates from both methods were similar to the observed distribution derived from VHF-collared calves. Both methods underestimated herd-wide calf survival based on VHF-collared calves, however, a combination of the individual- and population-based methods produced herd-wide survival estimates similar to estimates generated from collared calves. The limitations we experienced when applying the DeMars model could result from the shortcomings in our data violating model assumptions. However despite the differences in our caribou systems, with proper validation techniques the framework in the DeMars model is sufficient to make inferences on parturition and calf mortality.},

This technology is advancing our ability to study animal ecology by allowing researchers to (1) answer questions about the physiology, behavior, and ecology of wild animals in situ that would have previously been limited to tests on model organisms in highly controlled settings, (2) study cryptic or wide-ranging animals that have previously evaded investigation, and (3) develop and test entirely new theories.

  abstract = {The distinction between infection and disease may be subtle, and detection of disease in wild animal populations depends on the sophistication of sampling design and diagnostic techniques used in examining animal populations. The impact of infection on the host is dependent not only on the pathogenicity of the infection but also on the interactions between infection and other factors such as nutritional status and stress. In this paper I review mechanisms by which parasitic infections can influence the survival, reproduction, and movement patterns of infected individuals. I then discuss the implications for host populations, in particular with reference to the potential of parasites to regulate the abundance of host populations. The implications of infection and disease on host populations are then extended to demonstrate consequences on community structure. Difficulties associated with assessing the level of infection or disease in wild animal populations are discussed and used to account for the frequently held belief that disease rarely occurs in wild animal populations. Finally, the consequences of infection and disease for conservation biology are outlined. Disease is considered with regard to introductions and maintenance of genetic diversity. Emphasis is placed on the dangers associated with forcing animals into high-density situations. High host densities lead directly to increased disease because of increased transmission rates, and also indirectly increase disease because of synergistic interactions between infection, reduced nutritional status of the host population, and increased stress all associated with high-density situations. I recommend a surveillance program for monitoring prevalence or intensity in selected indicator age classes as a first step for preventing major disease problems in animal populations. I conclude that infection and disease will be an important determinant of the health and well being of animal populations, and as such must be considered in the design of conservation policy.},

  abstract = {Aldo Leopold's approach to environmental management changed drastically between the early 1920s, when he advocated predator eradication, and 1944, when he drafted "Thinking Like a Mountain." How are we to understand these changes? It is shown that, early in his career, Leopold developed the basic elements of a conservation ethic, borrowing key elements from the Russian organicist P. D. Ouspensky and from A. T. Hadley, an American pragmatist who was president of Yale University when Leopold was a student there. Hadley's pragmatism counseled that we act on the wisdom embodied in the intuitive perceptions of our forefathers. While Leopold changed the presentation of his conservation ethic over the years, he never gave up these key ideas, traces of which remain in the final version of "The Land Ethic." The changes in Leopold's management strategies were not due to a change in metaphysical or moral views, but to his evolving experience as a forester and game manager. Leopold learned that "violent" strategies such as monocultural planting of trees, pervasive agricultural management of fragile ecosystems and, above all, predator eradication, led to unforeseen and unwelcome results. Leopold recognized that we may never have adequate information to manipulate natural systems for maximal human utility without diminishing their vitality. He therefore lost faith in "economic biology" as a guide to environmental management. Leopold's changing views on management resulted from his experience as an environmental manager, not from a conversion from utilitarian anthropocentrism to biocentric nonanthropocentrism. While Leopold was drawn to Ouspensky's organicism, and he hoped Americans would, through a profound change in their perceptions of nature adopt such a view eventually, he believed throughout his career that long-sighted anthropocentrism provides an adequate basis for conservation practices.},

  abstract = {Selection of habitat components by ungulates associated with parturition sites varies among and within species depending upon vulnerability to predators, variation in local topography and climate regimes, and the length of time that the maternal?neonatal unit spends at or near the parturition location. We marked 169 parturition locations of elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) in western Wyoming using vaginal implant transmitters and evaluated parturition-specific habitat selection at macro- and microhabitat scales using a resource selection function modeling approach. Elk calved in a variety of habitats, yet demonstrated selection at both spatial scales. We found the strongest support for models that incorporated multiple habitat features and focused on topographical and vegetative cover types that provide physical and thermal cover at the macrohabitat scale and for visual cover models at the microhabitat scale. Models based solely on forage availability or quality were least supported at both scales, which may be indicative of a brief occupation of the parturition location or low heterogeneity in the availability of forage resources on parturition ranges. Results of early elk natural history studies may have represented a bias introduced by variable sightability and accessibility of females with calves and a lack of differentiation between calving and neonatal periods. More clearly defining calving site selection and removing biases toward more open habitats where sightability of neonates is greater may be used by wildlife or land managers to improve or protect calving habitats, which is often a stated objective of management actions. The results of this study suggest that microhabitat is more important to elk and that temporal closures over broad areas versus closures focused on specific macrohabitats may be more effective in protecting calving animals.},

  abstract = {Abstract Context. Timing (mean birthdate) and synchrony (variance around that date) of births can influence survival of young and growth in ungulate populations. Some restored populations of ungulates may not adjust these life-history characteristics to environments of release sites until several years after release, which may influence success of reintroductions. Aims. We quantified timing and synchrony of births from 2005 to 2007 in four populations of reintroduced bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) occupying two ecoregions (Central Basin and Range and Wasatch and Uinta Mountains) in Utah, USA, to investigate whether bighorns would adjust these life-history characteristics to environmental conditions of the two ecoregions. We also compared timing and synchrony of births for bighorns in their source herd (Antelope Island) with bighorns in an ecologically similar release site (Stansbury Mountains) during 2006 and 2007. Methods. We relocated female bighorns to record birthdates of young, and observed groups of collared bighorns to quantify use of elevation by those ungulates. We also calculated the initiation, rate and timing of peak green-up by ecoregion, using the normalised difference vegetation index. Key results. We quantified 274 birthdates, and although only separated by 57?km, bighorn populations occupying the Central Basin and Range Mountains gave birth an average of 29 days earlier than did those on the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains, which corresponded with the initiation of vegetation green-up. Additionally, bighorn sheep on the Stansbury Mountains (ecologically similar release site) gave birth at similar times as did bighorns on Antelope Island (source area). Conclusions. Populations of bighorn sheep that were reintroduced into adjacent ecoregions adjusted timing of births to environments and green-up of vegetation in restoration areas. Timing and synchrony of births for reintroduced bighorn sheep in an ecologically similar release site were the same as those of their source area. Implications. Consideration should be given to the adjustment of timing and synchrony of births when reintroducing bighorns, especially when animals are released into different ecoregions. Also, biologists should select release sites that are ecologically similar to source areas, thereby reducing potential negative effects of animals adjusting timing and synchrony of births to environmental conditions of restoration areas.},

  volume = {348},
  doi = {10.1126/science.aaa2478},
  abstract = {Researchers have long attempted to follow animals as they move through their environment. Until relatively recently, however, such efforts were limited to short distances and times in species large enough to carry large batteries and transmitters. New technologies have opened up new frontiers in animal tracking remote data collection. Hussey et al. review the unique directions such efforts have taken for marine systems, while Kays et al. review recent advances for terrestrial species. We have entered a new era of animal ecology, where animals act as both subjects and samplers of their environments.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255642, 10.1126/science.aaa2478BACKGROUNDThe movement of animals makes them fascinating but difficult study subjects. Animal movements underpin many biological phenomena, and understanding them is critical for applications in conservation, health, and food. Traditional approaches to animal tracking used field biologists wielding antennas to record a few dozen locations per animal, revealing only the most general patterns of animal space use. The advent of satellite tracking automated this process, but initially was limited to larger animals and increased the resolution of trajectories to only a few hundred locations per animal. The last few years have shown exponential improvement in tracking technology, leading to smaller tracking devices that can return millions of movement steps for ever-smaller animals. Finally, we have a tool that returns high-resolution data that reveal the detailed facets of animal movement and its many implications for biodiversity, animal ecology, behavior, and ecosystem function.ADVANCESImproved technology has brought animal tracking into the realm of big data, not only through high-resolution movement trajectories, but also through the addition of other on-animal sensors and the integration of remote sensing data about the environment through which these animals are moving. These new data are opening up a breadth of new scientific questions about ecology, evolution, and physiology and enable the use of animals as sensors of the environment. High\textendash{}temporal resolution movement data also can document brief but important contacts between animals, creating new opportunities to study social networks, as well as interspecific interactions such as competition and predation. With solar panels keeping batteries charged, ``lifetime'' tracks can now be collected for some species, while broader approaches are aiming for species-wide sampling across multiple populations. Miniaturized tags also help reduce the impact of the devices on the study subjects, improving animal welfare and scientific results. As in other disciplines, the explosion of data volume and variety has created new challenges and opportunities for information management, integration, and analysis. In an exciting interdisciplinary push, biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists have begun to develop new tools that are already leading to new insights and scientific breakthroughs.OUTLOOKWe suggest that a golden age of animal tracking science has begun and that the upcoming years will be a time of unprecedented exciting discoveries. Technology continues to improve our ability to track animals, with the promise of smaller tags collecting more data, less invasively, on a greater variety of animals. The big-data tracking studies that are just now being pioneered will become commonplace. If analytical developments can keep pace, the field will be able to develop real-time predictive models that integrate habitat preferences, movement abilities, sensory capacities, and animal memories into movement forecasts. The unique perspective offered by big-data animal tracking enables a new view of animals as naturally evolved sensors of environment, which we think has the potential to help us monitor the planet in completely new ways. A massive multi-individual monitoring program would allow a quorum sensing of our planet, using a variety of species to tap into the diversity of senses that have evolved across animal groups, providing new insight on our world through the sixth sense of the global animal collective. We expect that the field will soon reach a transformational point where these studies do more than inform us about particular species of animals, but allow the animals to teach us about the world.Big-data animal tracking.The red trajectory shows how studies can now track animals with unprecedented detail, allowing researchers to predict the causes and consequences of movements, and animals to become environmental sensors. Multisensor tracking tags monitor movement, behavior, physiology, and environmental context. Geo- and biosciences merge now using a multitude of remote-sensing data. Understanding how social and interspecific interactions affect movement is the next big frontier.Moving animals connect our world, spreading pollen, seeds, nutrients, and parasites as they go about the their daily lives. Recent integration of high-resolution Global Positioning System and other sensors into miniaturized tracking tags has dramatically improved our ability to describe animal movement. This has created opportunities and challenges that parallel big data transformations in other fields and has rapidly advanced animal ecology and physiology. New analytical approaches, combined with remotely sensed or modeled environmental information, have opened up a host of new questions on the causes of movement and its consequences for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. Simultaneous tracking of multiple animals is leading to new insights on species interactions and, scaled up, may enable distributed monitoring of both animals and our changing environment.},

  abstract = {* 1Wild large herbivores provide goods and income to rural communities, have major impacts on land use and habitats of conservation importance and, in some cases, face local or global extinction. As a result, substantial effort is applied to their management across the globe. To be effective, however, management has to be science-based. We reviewed recent fundamental and applied studies of large herbivores with particular emphasis on the relationship between the spatial and temporal scales of ecosystem response, management decision and implementation.
* 2Long-term population dynamics research has revealed fundamental differences in how sex/age classes are affected by changes in density and weather. Consequently, management must be tailored to the age and sex structure of the population, rather than to simple population counts.
* 3Herbivory by large ungulates shapes the structure, diversity and functioning of most terrestrial ecosystems. Recent research has shown that fundamental herbivore/vegetation interactions driving landscape change are localized, often at scales of a few metres. For example, sheep and deer will selectively browse heather Calluna vulgaris at the edge of preferred grass patches in heather moorland. As heather is vulnerable to heavy defoliation, in the long term this can lead to loss of heather cover despite the average utilization rate of heather in a management area being low. Therefore, while herbivore population management requires a large-scale approach, management of herbivore impacts on vegetation may require a much more flexible and site-specific approach.
* 4Localized impacts on vegetation have cascading effects on biodiversity, because changes in vegetation structure and composition, induced by large herbivores affect habitat suitability for many other species. As such, grazing should be considered as a tool for broader biodiversity management requiring a more sophisticated approach than just, for example, eliminating grazing from conservation areas through the use of exclosures.
* 5Synthesis and applications. The management of wild large herbivores must consider different spatial scales, from small patches of vegetation to boundaries of an animal population. It also requires long-term planning based on a deep understanding of how population processes, such a birth rate, death rate and age structure, are affected by changes in land use and climate and how these affect localized herbivore impacts. Because wild herbivores do not observe administrative or political boundaries, adjusting their management to socio-political realities can present a challenge. Many developing countries have established co-operative management groups that allow all interested parties to be involved in the development of management plans; developed countries have a lot to learn from the developing world's example.},

  abstract = {Home-range sizes and habitat selection among calving and non-calving female fallow deer Dama dama were analysed during the last months of pregnancy and following parturition. The study was carried out in central Italy using radio-tracking techniques. It was based on data collected on 23 adult females (calving n=15, non-calving n=8) from March 2003 to August 2003. Seasonal and bimonthly home-range analyses showed marked differential spatial behaviour between calving and non-calving females only when fawns were present. These were born during June, and the summer and July\textendash{}August home ranges of calving females were significantly lower than those recorded for non-calving ones. Although differences between spatial use of calving and non-calving females became significant only after the birth of fawns, habitat choices were significantly different from late pregnancy, when females had already reached parturition sites. Therefore, whereas during March\textendash{}April calving and non-calving females showed similar habitat choices, from May, habitat selection proved to be significantly different between the two classes of females. In particular, major differences were detected in the use of marshes and meadows. That female fallow deer adopt anti-predator tactics during the calving season was shown by their higher use of marshes, the habitat that offers the greatest cover and provides good concealment for fawns. Calving females avoided meadows, because these are open areas without any concealment for fawns; however they were selected by non-calving females as a function of their high productivity, as shown by analysis of the grass quality of the study site. The use of sub-optimal habitats by calving females because of the presence of fawns confirmed the findings of previous studies. These showed that ungulate mothers may move to poorer but safer habitats, compromising their energy intakes, to reduce the predation risk to their neonates.},

These impacts have ramifications for animals that share resources and across trophic levels. High deer densities result from an absence of predators or high plant productivity, often due to human habitat modifications, and from the desires of stakeholders that set deer management goals based on cultural, rather than biological, carrying capacity. Success at maintaining forest ecosystems require regulating deer below biological carrying capacity, as measured by ecological impacts. Control methods limit reproduction through modifications in habitat productivity or increase mortality through increasing predators or hunting. Hunting is the primary deer management tool and relies on active participation of citizens. Hunters are capable of reducing deer densities but struggle with creating densities sufficiently low to ensure the persistence of rare species. Alternative management models may be necessary to achieve densities sufficiently below biological carrying capacity. Regardless of the population control adopted, success should be measured by ecological benchmarks and not solely by cultural acceptance.},

  abstract = {Activity patterns of animals often relate to environmental variables such as food availability and predation pressure. Technological advances are providing us with new tools to monitor and better understand these activity patterns. We used animal-attached data loggers recording acceleration and depth to compare activity patterns and vertical habitat use of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Whale sharks showed a moderate reverse diel vertical migration but exhibited a clear crepuscular pattern in locomotory activity. Peak activity occurred at sunset, whereas vertical movement peaked prior to this. Typical ram surface filter feeding could be identified and occurred primarily during sunset and the first hours of night. At such times, direct observations indicated whale sharks were feeding on tropical krill swarms. Kinematic analysis of postural data and data from vertical movement suggests that whale sharks at Ningaloo spend \textasciitilde{}8~min per day actively ram surface filter feeding. Considering the high biomass present in krill schools, it is estimated that whale sharks at Ningaloo have a similar energy intake as those at other aggregation sites. Diel patterns in activity and diving behaviour suggest that whale sharks have tuned their diving behaviour in anticipation of the formation of these high-density patches which appear to only be periodically, but predictably available at sunset. Our results confirm that diel patterns in vertical habitat selection and vertical movements do not necessarily reflect patterns in activity and foraging behaviour. Direct quantification of activity and behaviour is required in gaining accurate representation of diel activity patterns.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0122811},
  abstract = {We present a simple framework for classifying mutually exclusive behavioural states within the geospatial lifelines of animals. This method involves use of three sequentially applied statistical procedures: (1) behavioural change point analysis to partition movement trajectories into discrete bouts of same-state behaviours, based on abrupt changes in the spatio-temporal autocorrelation structure of movement parameters; (2) hierarchical multivariate cluster analysis to determine the number of different behavioural states; and (3) k-means clustering to classify inferred bouts of same-state location observations into behavioural modes. We demonstrate application of the method by analysing synthetic trajectories of known `artificial behaviours' comprised of different correlated random walks, as well as real foraging trajectories of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) obtained by global-positioning-system telemetry. Our results show that the modelling procedure correctly classified 92.5\% of all individual location observations in the synthetic trajectories, demonstrating reasonable ability to successfully discriminate behavioural modes. Most individual little penguins were found to exhibit three unique behavioural states (resting, commuting/active searching, area-restricted foraging), with variation in the timing and locations of observations apparently related to ambient light, bathymetry, and proximity to coastlines and river mouths. Addition of k-means clustering extends the utility of behavioural change point analysis, by providing a simple means through which the behaviours inferred for the location observations comprising individual movement trajectories can be objectively classified.},

  abstract = {Monitoring and measuring the behaviour and movement of aquatic animals in the wild is typically challenging, though micro-accelerometer (archival or telemetry) tags now provide the means to remotely identify and quantify behavioural states and rates such as resting, swimming and migrating, and to estimate activity and energy budgets. Most studies use low-frequency ($\leq$32 Hz) accelerometer sampling because of battery and data-archiving constraints. In this study we assessed the effect of sampling frequency (aliasing) on activity detection probability using the great sculpin (Myoxocephalus polyacanthoceaphalus) as a model species. Feeding strikes and escape responses (fast-start activities) and spontaneous movements among seven different great sculpin were triggered, observed and recorded using video records and a tri-axial accelerometer sampling at 100 Hz. We demonstrate that multiple parameters in the time and probability domains can statistically differentiate between activities with high detection (90\%) and identification (80\%) probabilities. Detection probability for feeding and escape activities decreased by 50\% when sampling at \&lt;10 Hz. Our analyses illustrate additional problems associated with aliasing and how activity and energy-budget estimates can be compromised and misinterpreted. We recommend that high-frequency (\&gt;30 Hz) accelerometer sampling be used in similar laboratory and field studies. If battery and/or data storage is limited, we also recommend archiving the events via an on-board algorithm that determines the highest likelihood and subsequent archiving of the various event classes of interest.

Modelling species' niches is central to numerous ecological applications, including predicting species invasions, identifying reservoirs for disease, nature reserve design and forecasting the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on species' ranges.2A computational analogue of Hutchinson's ecological niche concept (the multidimensional hyperspace of species' environmental requirements) is the support of the distribution of environments in which the species persist. Recently developed machine-learning algorithms can estimate the support of such high-dimensional distributions. We show how support vector machines can be used to map ecological niches using only observations of species presence to train distribution models for 106 species of woody plants and trees in a montane environment using up to nine environmental covariates.3We compared the accuracy of three methods that differ in their approaches to reducing model complexity. We tested models with independent observations of both species presence and species absence. We found that the simplest procedure, which uses all available variables and no pre-processing to reduce correlation, was best overall. Ecological niche models based on support vector machines are theoretically superior to models that rely on simulating pseudo-absence data and are comparable in empirical tests.4Synthesis and applications. Accurate species distribution models are crucial for effective environmental planning, management and conservation, and for unravelling the role of the environment in human health and welfare. Models based on distribution estimation rather than classification overcome theoretical and practical obstacles that pervade species distribution modelling. In particular, ecological niche models based on machine-learning algorithms for estimating the support of a statistical distribution provide a promising new approach to identifying species' potential distributions and to project changes in these distributions as a result of climate change, land use and landscape alteration.},

  abstract = {Biologists can equip animals with global positioning system (GPS) technology to obtain accurate (less than or equal to 30 m) locations that can be combined with sensor data to study animal behaviour and ecology. We provide the background of GPS techniques that have been used to gather data for wildlife studies. We review how GPS has been integrated into functional systems with data storage, data transfer, power supplies, packaging and sensor technologies to collect temperature, activity, proximity and mortality data from terrestrial species and birds. GPS `rapid fixing' technologies combined with sensors provide location, dive frequency and duration profiles, and underwater acoustic information for the study of marine species. We examine how these rapid fixing technologies may be applied to terrestrial and avian applications. We discuss positional data quality and the capability for high-frequency sampling associated with GPS locations. We present alternatives for storing and retrieving data by using dataloggers (biologging), radio-frequency download systems (e.g. very high frequency, spread spectrum), integration of GPS with other satellite systems (e.g. Argos, Globalstar) and potential new data recovery technologies (e.g. network nodes). GPS is one component among many rapidly evolving technologies. Therefore, we recommend that users and suppliers interact to ensure the availability of appropriate equipment to meet animal research objectives. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Royal Society},

Quantifying the similarity between two songs, however, can be difficult and fraught with subjective bias. We present a fully automated procedure that measures parametrically the similarity between songs. We tested its performance on a large database of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, songs. The procedure uses an analytical framework of modern spectral analysis to characterize the acoustic structure of a song. This analysis provides a superior sound spectrogram that is then reduced to a set of simple acoustic features. Based on these features, the procedure detects similar sections between songs automatically. In addition, the procedure can be used to examine: (1) imitation accuracy across acoustic features; (2) song development; (3) the effect of brain lesions on specific song features; and (4) variability across different renditions of a song or a call produced by the same individual, across individuals and across populations. By making the procedure available we hope to promote the adoption of a standard, automated method for measuring similarity between songs or calls.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.specom.2007.01.006},
  abstract = {In this study, the robustness of approaches to the automatic classification of emotions in speech is addressed. Among the many types of emotions that exist, two groups of emotions are considered, adult-to-adult acted vocal expressions of common types of emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger and adult-to-infant vocal expressions of affective intents also known as ``motherese''. Specifically, we estimate the generalization capability of two feature extraction approaches, the approach developed for Sony's robotic dog AIBO (AIBO) and the segment-based approach (SBA) of [Shami, M., Kamel, M., 2005. Segment-based approach to the recognition of emotions in speech. In: IEEE Conf. on Multimedia and Expo (ICME05), Amsterdam, The Netherlands]. Three machine learning approaches are considered, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support vector machines (SVM) and Ada-boosted decision trees and four emotional speech databases are employed, Kismet, BabyEars, Danish, and Berlin databases. Single corpus experiments show that the considered feature extraction approaches AIBO and SBA are competitive on the four databases considered and that their performance is comparable with previously published results on the same databases. The best choice of machine learning algorithm seems to depend on the feature extraction approach considered. Multi-corpus experiments are performed with the Kismet\textendash{}BabyEars and the Danish\textendash{}Berlin database pairs that contain parallel emotional classes. Automatic clustering of the emotional classes in the database pairs shows that the patterns behind the emotions in the Kismet\textendash{}BabyEars pair are less database dependent than the patterns in the Danish\textendash{}Berlin pair. In off-corpus testing the classifier is trained on one database of a pair and tested on the other. This provides little improvement over baseline classification. In integrated corpus testing, however, the classifier is machine learned on the merged databases and this gives promisingly robust classification results, which suggest that emotional corpora with parallel emotion classes recorded under different conditions can be used to construct a single classifier capable of distinguishing the emotions in the merged corpora. Such a classifier is more robust than a classifier learned on a single corpus as it can recognize more varied expressions of the same emotional classes. These findings suggest that the existing approaches for the classification of emotions in speech are efficient enough to handle larger amounts of training data without any reduction in classification accuracy.},

However, today's commercially available intrusion detection systems are predominantly signature-based intrusion detection systems that are designed to detect known attacks by utilizing the signatures of those attacks. Such systems require frequent rule-base updates and signature updates, and are not capable of detecting unknown attacks. In contrast, anomaly detection systems, a subset of intrusion detection systems, model the normal system/network behavior which enables them to be extremely effective in finding and foiling both known as well as unknown or ``zero day'' attacks. While anomaly detection systems are attractive conceptually, a host of technological problems need to be overcome before they can be widely adopted. These problems include: high false alarm rate, failure to scale to gigabit speeds, etc. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of anomaly detection systems and hybrid intrusion detection systems of the recent past and present. We also discuss recent technological trends in anomaly detection and identify open problems and challenges in this area.},

  abstract = {Determining where, when and how much animals eat is fundamental to understanding their ecology. We developed a technique to identify a prey capture signature for little penguins from accelerometry, in order to quantify food intake remotely. We categorised behaviour of captive penguins from HD video and matched this to time-series data from back-mounted accelerometers. We then trained a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the penguins' behaviour at 0.3 s intervals as either `prey handling' or `swimming'. We applied this model to accelerometer data collected from foraging wild penguins to identify prey capture events. We compared prey capture and non-prey capture dives to test the model predictions against foraging theory. The SVM had an accuracy of 84.95$\pm$0.26\% (mean $\pm$ s.e.) and a false positive rate of 9.82$\pm$0.24\% when tested on unseen captive data. For wild data, we defined three independent, consecutive prey handling observations as representing true prey capture, with a false positive rate of 0.09\%. Dives with prey captures had longer duration and bottom times, were deeper, had faster ascent rates, and had more `wiggles' and `dashes' (proxies for prey encounter used in other studies). The mean ($\pm$s.e.) number of prey captures per foraging trip was 446.6$\pm$66.28. By recording the behaviour of captive animals on HD video and using a supervised machine learning approach, we show that accelerometry signatures can classify the behaviour of wild animals at unprecedentedly fine scales.},

  volume = {95},
  issn = {00222372, 15451542},
  abstract = {Investigating sources of infection for new disease cases is critical to effective disease management. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) was first detected among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Illinois in 2002. Although CWD was focused in northern Illinois, 4 infected deer were sampled in 2011 from locations greater than 100 km south of the disease focus. We used assignment tests (Geneclass2 and Oncor) to determine a likely genetic source location for infected deer. Our baseline data set consisted of 310 deer sampled from 10 locations. From the baseline data set, we determined the most likely genetic source location of 15 CWD-positive and 15 CWD-negative deer. A total of 17\&\#x2013;20\% back-assigned to their sample location as their most likely genetic source location and the remainder of the animals cross-assigned to another location. The average distance between locations was 41.4 km for Geneclass2 and 43.4 km for Oncor (range 0.0\&\#x2013;90.8 km). Distances between source and sampling locations were similar for positive and negative animals. Distances for males were greater than those for females using Oncor, but there was no difference in distance based on age. Because there are few barriers to gene flow for white-tailed deer, managers should reduce movement of deer in CWD-infected areas in an effort to reduce direct and indirect transmission of CWD.},

  abstract = {Understanding factors that influence the spread of wildlife diseases can assist in designing effective surveillance programs and appropriate management strategies. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal prion disease of cervids, was detected in south-central Wisconsin in 2002 and over time has been identified increasingly farther west in the state leading to concerns about CWD spreading to Iowa. Our objective was to characterize genetic connectivity between white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations in eastern Iowa and western Wisconsin to assess the risk of CWD-infected deer dispersing to Iowa. We hypothesized that the Mississippi River, which separates the states, may restrict the movement of deer and thus disease. We genotyped hunter-harvested female deer collected from both states at 12 nuclear microsatellite loci (n \&\#x2014; 249) and sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (n = 173). Microsatellite data indicated there was low genetic differentiation = (\&\#x3a6; PT 0.005) between states and weak spatial genetic structure across the study area as a whole. Verifying expectations that dispersal in deer is male-biased, maternally inherited mtDNA data showed stronger spatial structuring across the study area and greater genetic differentiation between the states = (\&\#x3a6; PT 0.005) such that clustering analysis grouped the majority of deer from Iowa and Wisconsin into separate clusters. The low level of genetic differentiation between deer in northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin, primarily the result of dispersing males who have greater CWD prevalence than females, indicates that the Mississippi River is unlikely to prohibit the westward spread of CWD, and underscores the importance of continued CWD surveillance in Iowa.},

  abstract = {The spread of parasites is inherently a spatial process often embedded in physically complex landscapes. It is therefore not surprising that infectious disease researchers are increasingly taking a landscape genetics perspective to elucidate mechanisms underlying basic ecological processes driving infectious disease dynamics and to understand the linkage between spatially dependent population processes and the geographic distribution of genetic variation within both hosts and parasites. The increasing availability of genetic information on hosts and parasites when coupled to their ecological interactions can lead to insights for predicting patterns of disease emergence, spread and control. Here, we review research progress in this area based on four different motivations for the application of landscape genetics approaches: (i) assessing the spatial organization of genetic variation in parasites as a function of environmental variability, (ii) using host population genetic structure as a means to parameterize ecological dynamics that indirectly influence parasite populations, for example, gene flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes and the concurrent transport of infectious agents, (iii) elucidating the temporal and spatial scales of disease processes and (iv) reconstructing and understanding infectious disease invasion. Throughout this review, we emphasize that landscape genetic principles are relevant to infection dynamics across a range of scales from within host dynamics to global geographic patterns and that they can also be applied to unconventional `landscapes' such as heterogeneous contact networks underlying the spread of human and livestock diseases. We conclude by discussing some general considerations and problems for inferring epidemiological processes from genetic data and try to identify possible future directions and applications for this rapidly expanding field.},

Relatively little is known about local transmission dynamics of the disease or the potential for long-distance spread. We analysed the population genetic structure of over 2000 white-tailed deer sampled from Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan using microsatellite profiles and mtDNA sequencing to assess the relative risk of disease spread. There was very little differentiation among subpopulations and a weak trend of increasing differentiation with geographic distance. This suggests that the potential for long-distance disease spread through the dispersal of infected individuals is possible, yet the risk of spread should gradually diminish with distance from infection foci. Within subpopulations, females were more related than expected by chance (R~$>$~0) within a radius of approximately 500~m. Sex-biased philopatry and social interactions among related females may facilitate local disease transmission within social groups. Local herd reduction may therefore be an effective tool for reducing the disease prevalence when implemented at the appropriate spatial scale.},

Nine nucleotide polymorphisms, seven silent and two coding, were found in the sampled population. All observed polymorphisms except two of very low frequency were observed in both negative and positive animals, although five polymorphic loci had significantly different distributions of alleles between infected and non-infected individuals. Nucleotide base changes 60C/T, 285A/C, 286G/A and 555C/T were observed with higher than expected frequencies in CWD negative animals suggesting disease resistance, while 153C/T was observed more than expected in positive animals, suggesting susceptibility. The two coding polymorphisms, 285A/C (Q95H) and 286G/A (G96S), have been described in white-tailed deer populations sampled in Colorado and Wisconsin. Frequency distributions of coding polymorphisms in Wisconsin and Illinois deer populations were different, an unexpected result considering the sampled areas are less than 150 km apart. The total number of polymorphisms per animal, silent or coding, was negatively correlated to disease status. The potential importance of silent polymorphisms (60C/T, 153C/T, 555C/T), either individually or cumulatively, in CWD disease status has not been previously reported.},

However, a model incorporating behavioral heterogeneity between individuals, and within individuals over time, was able to account for observed patterns of spread. Our results suggest that the main challenge for scaling up movement patterns resides in the complexities of individual behavior rather than in the spatial structure of the landscape.},

  abstract = {We present a framework for fitting multiple random walks to animal movement paths consisting of ordered sets of step lengths and turning angles. Each step and turn is assigned to one of a number of random walks, each characteristic of a different behavioral state. Behavioral state assignments may be inferred purely from movement data or may include the habitat type in which the animals are located. Switching between different behavioral states may be modeled explicitly using a state transition matrix estimated directly from data, or switching probabilities may take into account the proximity of animals to landscape features. Model fitting is undertaken within a Bayesian framework using the WinBUGS software. These methods allow for identification of different movement states using several properties of observed paths and lead naturally to the formulation of movement models. Analysis of relocation data from elk released in east-central Ontario, Canada, suggests a biphasic movement behavior: elk are either in an "encamped" state in which step lengths are small and turning angles are high, or in an "exploratory" state, in which daily step lengths are several kilometers and turning angles are small. Animals encamp in open habitat (agricultural fields and opened forest), but the exploratory state is not associated with any particular habitat type.},

The continuous-time formulation allows data that have been nonuniformly collected over time to be modeled without subsampling, interpolation, or aggregation to obtain a set of locations uniformly spaced in time. The model is derived from a continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck velocity process that is integrated to form a location process. The continuous-time model was placed into a state\&\#x2014;space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by-products available from the analysis, and different modifications which are possible. A harbor seal data set was analyzed with a model that incorporates the proportion of each hour spent on land. Also, a northern fur seal pup data set was analyzed with a random drift component to account for directed travel and ocean currents.},

  issn = {00129615},
  abstract = {Explaining and predicting animal movement in heterogeneous landscapes remains challenging. This is in part because movement paths often include a series of short, localized displacements separated by longer-distance forays. This multiphasic movement behavior reflects the complex response of an animal to present environmental conditions and to its internal behavioral state. This state is an autocorrelated process influenced by preceding behaviors and habitats visited. Movement patterns depending on the behavioral state of an animal represent the broad-scale response of that animal to the environment. Quantifying how animals respond both to local conditions and to their internal state reveals how animals respond to spatial heterogeneity at different spatial scales. We used a state\&\#x2014;space statistical approach to model the internal behavioral state and the proximate movement response of elk (Cervus elaphus) to available forage biomass, landscape composition, topography, and wolf (Canis lupus) density during summer in Yellowstone National Park, USA. We analyzed movement paths of 16 female elk fitted with global positioning system (GPS) radio collars that recorded locations at 5-h intervals. Habitat variables were quantified within 175 m radii (one-half of the median 5-h displacement) centered on the beginning location of each interval. Stepwise model selection identified models that best explained the movement distances of each animal. The behavioral state changed very slowly for most animals (median autocorrelation r = 0.93), and all animals responded strongly to time of day (with more movement in the crepuscular hours). However, the spatial variables included in the best-fitting models varied substantially among individual elk. These results suggest that strong patterns of habitat selection observed in other studies may result from frequent visits to preferred areas rather than a reduction of movement in those areas.},

  abstract = {Animal movement is essential to our understanding of population dynamics, animal behavior, and the impacts of global change. Coupled with high-resolution biotelemetry data, exciting new inferences about animal movement have been facilitated by various specifications of contemporary models. These approaches differ, but most share common themes. One key distinction is whether the underlying movement process is conceptualized in discrete or continuous time. This is perhaps the greatest source of confusion among practitioners, both in terms of implementation and biological interpretation. In general, animal movement occurs in continuous time but we observe it at fixed discrete-time intervals. Thus, continuous time is conceptually and theoretically appealing, but in practice it is perhaps more intuitive to interpret movement in discrete intervals. With an emphasis on state-space models, we explore the differences and similarities between continuous and discrete versions of mechanistic movement models, establish some common terminology, and indicate under which circumstances one form might be preferred over another. Counter to the overly simplistic view that discrete- and continuous-time conceptualizations are merely different means to the same end, we present novel mathematical results revealing hitherto unappreciated consequences of model formulation on inferences about animal movement. Notably, the speed and direction of movement are intrinsically linked in current continuous-time random walk formulations, and this can have important implications when interpreting animal behavior. We illustrate these concepts in the context of state-space models with multiple movement behavior states using northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) biotelemetry data.},

Yet it has proven difficult to develop frameworks for analyzing animal movement that can test these interactions. Here we describe a novel method for fitting movement models to data that can incorporate diverse aspects of landscapes and behavior. Using data from five elk (Cervus canadensis) reintroduced to central Ontario, we employed artificial neural networks to estimate movement probability kernels as functions of three landscape\&\#x2010;behavioral processes. These consisted of measures of the animals\&\#x2019; response to the physical spatial structure of the landscape, the spatial variability in resources, and memory of previously visited locations. The results support the view that animal movement results from interactions among elements of landscape structure and behavior, motivating context\&\#x2010;dependent movement probabilities, rather than from successive realizations of static distributions, as some traditional models of movement and resource selection assume. Flexible, nonlinear models may thus prove useful in understanding the mechanisms controlling animal movement patterns.},

  abstract = {Automated animal behaviour monitoring systems have become increasingly appealing for research and animal production management purposes. However, many existing systems are suited to measure only one or two behaviour patterns or activity states at a time. We aimed to develop and pilot a method for automatically measuring and recognising several behavioural patterns of dairy cows using a three-dimensional accelerometer and a multi-class support vector machine (SVM). SVM classification models were constructed based on nine features. The models were trained using observations made of the behaviour of 30 cows fitted with a neck collar bearing an accelerometer that recorded horizontal, vertical and lateral acceleration. Measured behaviour patterns included standing, lying, ruminating, feeding, normal and lame walking, lying down, and standing up. Accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and kappa measures were used to evaluate the model performance. The SVM classification models achieved a reasonable recognition of standing (80\% sensitivity, 65\% precision), lying (80\%, 83\%), ruminating (75\%, 86\%), feeding (75\%, 81\%), walking normally (79\%, 79\%), and lame walking (65\%, 66\%). The results were poor for lying down (0\%, 0\%) and standing up (71\%, 29\%). The overall performance of the multi-class model was 78\% precision with a kappa value of 0.69. Each of the behaviour categories had one or two other behaviour patterns that became confused with them the most. The problematic behaviours were expectedly those that resemble each other in terms of movement. Possible solutions for the problems in classification are presented. In conclusion, accelerometers can be used to easily recognise various behaviour patterns in dairy cows. Support vector machines proved useful in classification of measured behaviour patterns. However, further work is needed to refine the features used in the classification models in order to gain the best possible classification performance. Also the quality of acceleration data needs to be considered to improve the results.},

  volume = {215},
  doi = {10.1242/jeb.058602},
  abstract = {Integrating biomechanics, behavior and ecology requires a mechanistic understanding of the processes producing the movement of animals. This calls for contemporaneous biomechanical, behavioral and environmental data along movement pathways. A recently formulated unifying movement ecology paradigm facilitates the integration of existing biomechanics, optimality, cognitive and random paradigms for studying movement. We focus on the use of tri-axial acceleration (ACC) data to identify behavioral modes of GPS-tracked free-ranging wild animals and demonstrate its application to study the movements of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus, Hablizl 1783). In particular, we explore a selection of nonlinear and decision tree methods that include support vector machines, classification and regression trees, random forest methods and artificial neural networks and compare them with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a baseline for classifying behavioral modes. Using a dataset of 1035 ground-truthed ACC segments, we found that all methods can accurately classify behavior (80\textendash{}90\%) and, as expected, all nonlinear methods outperformed LDA. We also illustrate how ACC-identified behavioral modes provide the means to examine how vulture flight is affected by environmental factors, hence facilitating the integration of behavioral, biomechanical and ecological data. Our analysis of just over three-quarters of a million GPS and ACC measurements obtained from 43 free-ranging vultures across 9783 vulture-days suggests that their annual breeding schedule might be selected primarily in response to seasonal conditions favoring rising-air columns (thermals) and that rare long-range forays of up to 1750 km from the home range are performed despite potentially heavy energetic costs and a low rate of food intake, presumably to explore new breeding, social and long-term resource location opportunities.},

First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models\textemdash{}Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)\textemdash{}for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

Animal positions provide the elemental unit of movement paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists in their search for a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness.

Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error and irregular measurement intervals or gappiness. Furthermore, movement data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a likelihood?based method that allows for the identification of significant structural changes. The BCPA is robust to gappiness and measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile, and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the ARGOS tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement data, we suggest that the BCPA can eventually motivate the development of mechanistic behavioural models.},

Matriarch does defended the same fawning area annually; primiparous (2-year-old) daughters occupied adjacent exclusive sites, whereas 3-year-olds established new grounds away from the family group. Unsuccessful mothers failed to exhibit any prolonged solitary or aggressive behavior. Triplet siblings shared a common home range after 2 weeks, but bedded separately until 1 month old.

Doe-fawn spacing decreased after 2 weeks postpartum in the case of a singleton, but not until a month later for the triplet litter. A mother and her fawn(s) did not continuously associate with other deer before the 3rd month.

  abstract = {Activity patterns, habitat use, and home range characteristics of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on the George Reserve, Michigan, were studied from 1981 to 1984 through the use of motion-sensitive radio collars. Mean percent of time active for both sexes peaked in spring and fall with a pronounced low in January and February and a moderate low in June and July. Females were significantly more active than males during January through June. This seasonal pattern, and differences by sex, were consistent with seasonal and sexual differences in metabolic demand relative to food resources. During most months, deer exhibited a diel activity pattern with peaks at sunset and just after sunrise. The sexes did not differ in diel patterns except during September and October when males were more active at night and females more active by day. Deer activity decreased with snow depth, even at slight snow depths, probably because of changes in food availability. Deer activity was maximum at temperatures of 6-16 C and decreased at both higher and lower temperatures. Effects of temperature varied with time of day, season, cloud cover, wind speed, and habitat. Moonlight had little or no influence on nighttime activity or habitat use by deer. There were no marked shifts in use of vegetation types among spring, summer, and fall. Winter habitat use differed strongly from that in the other 8 seasons, with grasslands, swamps, and bogs used more and closed forests used less than during other seasons. Weather variables influenced habitat use during winter, but not during other seasons. Increased use of swamps and decreased use of closed forests, open woodlands, and grasslands were associated with increasing snow depth, but could not be explained solely by the swamp microclimate. Swamps also may facilitate deer aggregation to reduce the risk of predation under deep snow conditions. Deer used closed vegetation types during daytime and open types at dusk, night, and dawn. The sexes differed in habitat use, with males making greater use of closed forests and females greater use of open woodlands and grassland. Seasonal home ranges on the George Reserve (males-142 ha; females-45 ha) were smaller than reported elsewhere, probably because of high interspersion of habitat types. The difference in home range size between the sexes could not be explained solely by differences in metabolic weight. Social behavior and use of less productive habitats by males may account for this difference. Females showed site fidelity across seasons and years. Males used the same summer range from year to year, but tended to shift home ranges between winter and summer. Some individual males also changed winter ranges annually.},

From 1986 until 1988 social and spatial relationships of 11 parturient female white-tailed deer were monitored at the National Zoological Park's Conservation and Research Center to determine their degree and duration of isolation from conspecifics. Social isolation at and following parturition was indicated by decreased association with other parturient females and with their own previous offspring. Parturient females also showed characteristic patterns of spacing behaviour that resulted in complete segregation of core home ranges. These areas encompassed nearly all bedding sites of fawns during the first 6 weeks following parturition and conspecifics were repulsed through overt aggression. The exclusive use, the annual fidelity to these postpartum home ranges and the active repulsion of intruders indicated that female white-tailed deer are territorial during the first weeks postpartum. Predation pressure and the risk of misdirected imprinting may have had a combined effect on the evolution of this territoriality.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of reproductive success is important in understanding the population dynamics of elk (Cervus elaphus), yet currently there are few methods to determine the occurrence, location, and time of birth events. We quantitatively describe differences in movements and behaviors of radiocollared maternal and barren female elk at calving time in northwest Montana from 1995 to 1997 that can be used to determine birthing. Except for maternal females \&\#xb1;4 days of parturition, females averaged 712 m between successive daily locations. Movements of maternal females averaged 1,759 m during the 4 days pre-partum and 305 m during the 4 days post-partum. Barren females did not exhibit similar movement patterns. From 14 to 5 days pre-partum, maternal females averaged 2,671 m from the eventual birthing site. Calving areas were at the edge of or outside the area used during the 14 days pre-partum. Females typically did not visit these sites before giving birth and moved there within 2 days of parturition. Four of 5 females with $>$1 year's data gave birth $<$100 m from where they had previously. Females usually isolated themselves at parturition for approximately 6 days. Our results can help determine time and location of calving and estimate late-term pregnancy rates, initial calf production and reproductive success of females, and help in capturing neonate calves.},

To date there have been few studies comparing the performances of these methods and features used for call-type-independent species and individual identification. We compared the performance of four machine-learning classifiers in the identification of ten passerine species, and individual identification for three passerines using two acoustic features. The methods did not require us to pre-categorize the component syllables in call-type-independent species and individual identification systems. The results of our experiment indicated that support vector machines (SVM) performed best generally, regardless of which acoustic feature was used, linear predictive coefficients (LPCs) increased the recognition accuracies of hidden Markov models (HMM) greatly, and the most appropriate classifiers for LPCs and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were HMM and SVM respectively. This study will assist researchers in selecting classifiers and features to use in future species and individual recognition studies.},

  abstract = {Four different methods of using small data sets in multivariate modelling are compared w.r.t. predictive precision in the long-run. The modelling in this case concerns multivariate calibration: \^y=f(X). The study consists of a Monte Carlo simulation within a large data base of real data; X=NIR reflectance spectra and y=protein percentage, measured in 922 whole maize plant samples. Small data sets (40\textendash{}120 objects) were repeatedly selected at random from the data base, each time simulating the situation of having only a small set of samples available for estimating, optimizing and assessing the calibration model. The ‘true' apparent prediction error was each time controlled in the remaining data base. This was replicated 100 times in order to study the statistical performance of the four different validation methods. In each Monte Carlo replicate, the splitting of the available data set into calibration set and test set was compared to full cross validation. The results demonstrated that removing samples from an already limited set of available samples to an independent VALIDATION TEST SET seriously reduced the predictive performance of the calibrated models, and at the same time gave uncertain, systematically over-optimistic assessment of the models' predictive performance. Full CROSS VALIDATION gave improved predictive performance, and gave only slightly over-optimistic assessment of this predictive performance. Further removal of even more of the available samples for use in an independent VERIFICATION TEST SET gave in-the-long-run correct, although uncertain estimates of the predictive performance of the calibrated models, but this performance level had seriously deteriorated. Alternative verification of the model's predictive performance by the method of CROSS VERIFICATION gave results very similar to those of the cross validation. These results from real data correspond closely to previous findings for artificially simulated data. It appears that full cross validation is superior to both the use of independent validation test set and independent verification test set.},

We compare and discuss the use of AUC to the more conventional overall accuracy and find that AUC exhibits a number of desirable properties when compared to overall accuracy: increased sensitivity in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests; a standard error that decreased as both AUC and the number of test samples increased; decision threshold independent; and it is invariant to a priori class probabilities. The paper concludes with the recommendation that AUC be used in preference to overall accuracy for ``single number'' evaluation of machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in sheep and an example of a disease that may be controlled through breeding for disease resistance. Member states of the European Union have introduced strategies for breeding against scrapie based on the selection of genetically resistant breeding rams. An ambitious strategy adopted in The Netherlands consisted of selecting resistant rams for breeding throughout both breeding and production sectors. Mathematical modelling of the effect of a breeding program on the spreading capacity of scrapie in a national flock is needed for making assessments on how long a breeding strategy needs to be maintained to achieve disease control. Here we describe such a model applied to the Dutch situation, with the use of data on the genetic content of the Dutch sheep population as well as on scrapie occurrence in this population. We show that the time needed for obtaining scrapie control depends crucially on two parameters measuring sheep population structure: the between-flock heterogeneity in genotype frequencies, and the heterogeneity of mixing (contact rates) between sheep flocks. Estimating the first parameter from Dutch genetic survey data and assuming scenario values for the second one, enables model prediction of the time needed to achieve scrapie control in The Netherlands.},

Also, we sub-sampled photographs of each species with each camera trapping technique to determine the minimum sample size needed to maintain accuracy and precision of estimates. Camera trapping estimated greater activity during feeding times than radiotags in all but the carnivore, likely reflective of the close proximity of foods readily consumed by all species except the carnivore (i.e., corn bait or acorns). However, additional analyses still indicated both camera trapping methods produced relatively high overlap and correlation to radiotags. Regardless of species or camera trapping method, mean overlap increased and overlap error decreased rapidly as sample sizes increased until an asymptote near 100 detections which we therefore recommend as a minimum sample size. Researchers should acknowledge that camera traps and radiotags may estimate the same mode of activity but differ in their estimation of magnitude in activity peaks.},

  abstract = {Statistical population reconstruction offers a robust approach to demographic assessment for harvested populations, but current methods are restricted to big-game species with multiple age classes. We extended this approach to small game and analyzed 14 years of age-at-harvest data for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus uropbasianus) in Oregon, USA, in conjunction with radiotelemetry data to reconstruct annual abundance levels, recruitment, and natural survival probabilities. Abundance estimates ranged from a low of 26,236 in 1995 to a high of 39,492 in 2004. Annual abundance estimates for adult males were correlated with a spring lek count index (r = 0.849, P\&lt;0.029). We estimated the average annual harvest mortality for the population to be 0.028, ranging from 0.021 to 0.031 across years. We estimated the probability of natural survival of adult females to be 0.818 ( \$$\backslash$widehat\{\{$\backslash$rm SE\}\}\$ = 0.052), somewhat higher than that of adult males (\&\#x15c; = 0.609, \$$\backslash$widehat\{\{$\backslash$rm SE\}\}\$ = 0.163). Our precision in reconstructing the population was hampered by low harvest rates and the few birds tagged in the radiotelemetry investigations. Despite these issues, our analysis illustrates how modern statistical reconstruction procedures offer a flexible framework for demographic assessment using commonly collected data. This approach offers a useful alternative to small-game indices and would be most appropriate for species with 5 or more years of age-at-harvest data and moderate-to-heavy harvest rates.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy that affects free-ranging and captive North American cervids. Although the impacts of CWD on cervid survival have been documented, little is known about the disease impacts on reproduction and recruitment. We used genetic methods and harvest data (2002?04) to reconstruct parentage for a cohort of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawns born in spring 2002 and evaluate the effects of CWD infection on reproduction and fawn harvest vulnerability. There was no difference between CWD-positive and CWD-negative male deer in the probability of being a parent. However, CWD-positive females were more likely to be parents than CWD-negative females. Because our results are based on harvested animals, we evaluated the hypothesis that higher parentage rates occurred because fawns with CWD-positive mothers were more vulnerable to harvest. Male fawns with CWD-positive mothers were harvested earlier ($>$1 mo relative to their mother?s date of harvest) and farther away from their mothers than male fawns with CWD-negative mothers. Male fawns with CWD-positive mothers were also harvested much earlier and farther away than female fawns from CWD-positive mothers. Most female fawns (86\%) with CWD-positive mothers were harvested from the same section as their mothers, while almost half of male and female fawns with CWD-negative mothers were farther away. We conclude that preclinical stages of CWD infection do not prohibit white-tailed deer from successfully reproducing. However, apparently higher harvest vulnerability of male fawns with CWD-positive mothers suggests that CWD infection may make females less capable of providing adequate parental care to ensure the survival and recruitment of their fawns.},

  abstract = {A challenge in animal ecology is to link animal movement to demography. In general, reproducing and non-reproducing animals may show different movement patterns. Dramatic changes in reproductive status, such as the loss of an offspring during the course of migration, might also affect movement. Studies linking movement speed to reproductive status require individual monitoring of life-history events and hence are rare. Here, we link movement data from 98 GPS-collared female moose (Alces alces) to field observations of reproductive status and calf survival. We show that reproductive females move more quickly during migration than non-reproductive females. Further, the loss of a calf over the course of migration triggered a decrease in speed of the female. This is in contrast to what might be expected for females no longer constrained by an accompanying offspring. The observed patterns demonstrate that females of different reproductive status may have distinct movement patterns, and that the underlying motivation to move may be altered by a change in reproductive status during migration.},

Mark\textendash{}recapture is a powerful, underutilized, tool for calculating impacts of disease on population size and structure, even in the absence of etiological information. We applied logistic regression models to mark\textendash{}recapture data to obtain estimates of disease-associated mortality rates in three commercially important marine species: snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) in Newfoundland, Canada, that experience sporadic epizootics of bitter crab disease; striped bass (Morone saxatilis) in the Chesapeake Bay, USA, that experience chronic dermal and visceral mycobacteriosis; and American lobster (Homarus americanus) in the Southern New England stock, that experience chronic epizootic shell disease. All three diseases decreased survival of diseased hosts. Survival of diseased adult male crabs was 1\% (0.003\textendash{}0.022, 95\% CI) that of uninfected crabs indicating nearly complete mortality of infected crabs in this life stage. Survival of moderately and severely diseased striped bass (which comprised 15\% and 11\% of the population, respectively) was 84\% (70\textendash{}100\%, 95\% CI), and 54\% (42\textendash{}68\%, 95\% CI) that of healthy striped bass. The disease-adjusted yearly natural mortality rate for striped bass was 0.29, nearly double the previously accepted value, which did not include disease. Survival of moderately and severely diseased lobsters was 30\% (15\textendash{}60\%, 95\% CI) that of healthy lobsters and survival of mildly diseased lobsters was 45\% (27\textendash{}75\%, 95\% CI) that of healthy lobsters. High disease mortality in ovigerous females may explain the poor recruitment and rapid declines observed in this population. Stock assessments should account for disease-related mortality when resource management options are evaluated.},

  abstract = {Analyses of animal resource selection functions (RSF) using data collected from relocations of individuals via remote telemetry devices have become commonplace. Increasing technological advances, however, have produced statistical challenges in analysing such highly autocorrelated data. Weighted distribution methods have been proposed for analysing RSFs with telemetry data. However, they can be computationally challenging due to an intractable normalizing constant and cannot be aggregated (i.e. collapsed) over time to make space-only inference. In this study, we take a conceptually different approach to modelling animal telemetry data for making RSF inference. We consider the telemetry data to be a realization of a space\textendash{}time point process. Under the point process paradigm, the times of the relocations are also considered to be random rather than fixed. We show the point process models we propose are a generalization of the weighted distribution telemetry models. By generalizing the weighted model, we can access several numerical techniques for evaluating point process likelihoods that make use of common statistical software. Thus, the analysis methods can be readily implemented by animal ecologists. In addition to ease of computation, the point process models can be aggregated over time by marginalizing over the temporal component of the model. This allows a full range of models to be constructed for RSF analysis at the individual movement level up to the study area level. To demonstrate the analysis of telemetry data with the point process approach, we analysed a data set of telemetry locations from northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska. Both a space\textendash{}time and an aggregated space-only model were fitted. At the individual level, the space\textendash{}time analysis showed little selection relative to the habitat covariates. However, at the study area level, the space-only model showed strong selection relative to the covariates.},

Simultaneously, wildlife disease management (WDM) presents opportunities for large-scale empirical tests of disease ecology theory in diverse natural systems.To assess whether the potential complementarity between WDM and disease ecology theory has been realized, we evaluate the extent to which specific concepts in disease ecology theory have been explicitly applied in peer-reviewed WDM literature.While only half of WDM articles published in the past decade incorporated disease ecology theory, theory has been incorporated with increasing frequency over the past 40~years. Contrary to expectations, articles authored by academics were no more likely to apply disease ecology theory, but articles that explain unsuccessful management often do so in terms of theory.Some theoretical concepts such as density-dependent transmission have been commonly applied, whereas emerging concepts such as pathogen evolutionary responses to management, biodiversity\textendash{}disease relationships and within-host parasite interactions have not yet been fully integrated as management considerations.Synthesis and applications. Theory-based disease management can meet the needs of both academics and managers by testing disease ecology theory and improving disease interventions. Theoretical concepts that have received limited attention to date in wildlife disease management could provide a basis for improving management and advancing disease ecology in the future.},

  doi = {10.1890/05-0549},
  abstract = {Robert H. Whittaker defined beta diversity as the variation in species composition among sites in a geographic area. Beta diversity is a key concept for understanding the functioning of ecosystems, for the conservation of biodiversity, and for ecosystem management. This paper explains how hypotheses about the origin of beta diversity can be tested by partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data (presence\textendash{} absence or abundance data) with respect to environmental variables and spatial base functions. We compare two statistical methods to accomplish that. The sum-of-squares of a community composition data table, which is one possible measure of beta diversity, is correctly partitioned by canonical ordination; hence, canonical partitioning produces correct estimates of the different portions of community composition variation. In recent years, several authors interested in the variation in community composition among sites (beta diversity) have used another method, variation partitioning on distance matrices (Mantel approach). Their results led us to compare the two partitioning approaches, using simulated data generated under hypotheses about the variation of community composition among sites. The theoretical developments and simulation results led to the following observations: (1) the variance of a community composition table is a measure of beta diversity. (2) The variance of a dissimilarity matrix among sites is not the variance of the community composition table nor a measure of beta diversity; hence, partitioning on distance matrices should not be used to study the variation in community composition among sites. (3) In all of our simulations, partitioning on distance matrices underestimated the amount of variation in community composition explained by the raw-data approach, and (4) the tests of significance had less power than the tests of canonical ordination. Hence, the proper statistical procedure for partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data among environmental and spatial components, and for testing hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of variation in community composition among sites, is canonical partitioning. The Mantel approach is appropriate for testing other hypotheses, such as the variation in beta diversity among groups of sites. Regression on distance matrices is also appropriate for fitting models to similarity decay plots.},

  abstract = {Inferences about animal behavior from movement models typically rely solely on location data, but auxiliary biotelemetry and environmental data are powerful and readily available resources for incorporating much more behavioral realism. Integrating multiple data streams can not only reveal hidden behaviors and ecological relationships that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to infer from location data alone, but also facilitate more realistic path reconstruction that respects important ecological features while bridging the information gaps that commonly arise due to measurement error or missing data. Using the bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), a benthic predator associated with Arctic sea ice, we demonstrate how integrating location, dive activity, land cover, bathymetry, and sea ice data in a unified modeling framework allowed us to identify novel behavior states, such as hauling out on seasonal sea ice and those associated with competing foraging strategies (i.e., benthic vs. mid-water prey). By utilizing multiple data streams, ecologists can move beyond conventional two-state models (``foraging'' and ``transit'') and address more interesting hypotheses about activity budgets, resource selection, and many other areas of movement and behavioral ecology. The generality of our approach provides broad applicability to marine and terrestrial species, as well as many types of biotelemetry and environmental data.},

Understanding population genetic structure within a continuous population can give insights into social structure, movement across the landscape and contact between populations, which influence ecological interactions, reproductive dynamics or pathogen transmission. We investigated the genetic structure of a large population of deer spanning the area of Wisconsin and Illinois, USA, affected by chronic wasting disease. We combined multiscale investigation, landscape genetic techniques and spatial statistical modelling to address the complex questions of landscape factors influencing population structure. We sampled over 2000 deer and used spatial autocorrelation and a spatial principal components analysis to describe the population genetic structure. We evaluated landscape effects on this pattern using a spatial autoregressive model within a model selection framework to test alternative hypotheses about gene flow. We found high levels of genetic connectivity, with gradients of variation across the large continuous population of white-tailed deer. At the fine scale, spatial clustering of related animals was correlated with the amount and arrangement of forested habitat. At the broader scale, impediments to dispersal were important to shaping genetic connectivity within the population. We found significant barrier effects of individual state and interstate highways and rivers. Our results offer an important understanding of deer biology and movement that will help inform the management of this species in an area where overabundance and disease spread are primary concerns.},

  abstract = {The tools we use to investigate infectious diseases tend to focus on specific one-host\textendash{}one-pathogen relationships, but pathogens often have complex life cycles involving many hosts. Johnson et al. review how such complexity is analyzed by community ecologists. Ecologists have the investigative tools to probe cause and effect relationships that change with spatial scale in multispecies communities. These techniques are used to monitor the ways in which communities change through time and to probe the heterogeneity that characterizes individuals, species, and assemblages\textemdash{}all issues that are also essential for disease specialists to understand.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1259504BACKGROUNDDespite ongoing advances in biomedicine, infectious diseases remain a major threat to human health, economic sustainability, and wildlife conservation. This is in part a result of the challenges of controlling widespread or persistent infections that involve multiple hosts, vectors, and parasite species. Moreover, many contemporary disease threats involve interactions that manifest across nested scales of biological organization, from disease progression at the within-host level to emergence and spread at the regional level. For many such infections, complete eradication is unlikely to be successful, but a broader understanding of the community in which host-parasite interactions are embedded will facilitate more effective management. Recent advances in community ecology, including findings from traits-based approaches and metacommunity theory, offer the tools and concepts to address the complexities arising from multispecies, multiscale disease threats.ADVANCESCommunity ecology aims to identify the factors that govern the structure, assembly, and dynamics of ecological communities. We describe how analytical and conceptual approaches from this discipline can be used to address fundamental challenges in disease research, such as (i) managing the ecological complexity of multihost-multiparasite assemblages; (ii) identifying the drivers of heterogeneities among individuals, species, and regions; and (iii) quantifying how processes link across multiple scales of biological organization to drive disease dynamics. We show how a community ecology framework can help to determine whether infection is best controlled through ``defensive'' approaches that reduce host suitability or through ``offensive'' approaches that dampen parasite spread. Examples of defensive approaches are the strategic use of wildlife diversity to reduce host and vector transmission, and taking advantage of antagonism between symbionts to suppress within-host growth and pathology. Offensive approaches include the targeted control of superspreading hosts and the reduction of human-wildlife contact rates to mitigate spillover. By identifying the importance of parasite dispersal and establishment, a community ecology framework can offer additional insights about the scale at which disease should be controlled.OUTLOOKOngoing technological advances are rapidly overcoming previous barriers in data quality and quantity for complex, multispecies systems. The emerging synthesis of ``disease community ecology'' offers the tools and concepts necessary to interpret these data and use that understanding to inform the development of more effective disease control strategies in humans and wildlife. Looking forward, we emphasize the increasing importance of tight integration among surveillance, community ecology analyses, and public health implementation. Building from the rich legacy of whole-system manipulations in community ecology, we further highlight the value of large-scale experiments for understanding host-pathogen interactions and designing effective control measures. Through this blending of data, theory, and analytical approaches, we can understand how interactions between parasites within hosts, hosts within populations, and host species within ecological communities combine to drive disease dynamics, thereby providing new ways to manage emerging infections.The community ecology of disease.(A) Interactions between parasites can complicate management. Among Tsimane villagers, treatment of hookworms increases infections by Giardia lamblia. (B) Similarly, understanding how ecological communities of hosts assemble can help forecast changes in disease. Biodiversity losses can promote interactions between white-footed mice and deer ticks, leading to an increase in the risk of Lyme disease from Borrelia burgdorferi.[Credits: (A) A. Pisor, CDC, F. Dubs; (B) J. Brunner, T. Shears, NIH]Infectious diseases often emerge from interactions among multiple species and across nested levels of biological organization. Threats as diverse as Ebola virus, human malaria, and bat white-nose syndrome illustrate the need for a mechanistic understanding of the ecological interactions underlying emerging infections. We describe how recent advances in community ecology can be adopted to address contemporary challenges in disease research. These analytical tools can identify the factors governing complex assemblages of multiple hosts, parasites, and vectors, and reveal how processes link across scales from individual hosts to regions. They can also determine the drivers of heterogeneities among individuals, species, and regions to aid targeting of control strategies. We provide examples where these principles have enhanced disease management and illustrate how they can be further extended.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an infectious prion disease that affects mule deer, along with other Cervids. It is a slow-developing, fatal disease which is rare in the free-ranging deer population of Utah. We present a sex-structured, spatial model for the spread of CWD over heterogeneous landscapes, incorporating both horizontal and environmental transmission pathways. To connect the local movement of deer to the regional spread of CWD, we use ecological diffusion with motility coefficients estimated from mule deer movement data. Ecological diffusion allows for aggregation of populations in desirable habitats and therefore allows for an interaction between density dependent disease transmission and landscape structure. The major innovation presented is use of homogenization to accelerate simulations of disease spread in southeastern Utah, from the La Sal Mountains near Moab to the Abajo Mountains near Monticello. The homogenized model provides accuracy while maintaining fidelity to small-scale habitat effects on deer distribution, including differential aggregation in land cover types with high residence times, with errors comparable to the order parameter measuring separation of small and large scales (                                                                          \$\$$\backslash$epsilon $\backslash$approx .01\$\$                                                                                    $\epsilon$                        $\approx$                        .                        01                                                                             in this case).

We built a boosted regression tree model to predict the probability of the persistent presence of CWD in a region of northern Illinois using CWD surveillance in deer and soils data. We evaluated the outcome for possible pathways by which soil characteristics may increase the probability of CWD transmission via environmental contamination. Soil clay content and pH were the most important predictive soil characteristics of the persistent presence of CWD. The results suggest that exposure to prions in the environment is greater where percent clay is less than 18\% and soil pH is greater than 6.6. These characteristics could alter availability of prions immobilized in soil and contribute to the environmental risk factors involved in the epidemiological complexity of CWD infection in natural populations of white-tailed deer.},

Spatially explicit epidemic models often rely on assumptions about system boundaries and processes for spread that may not faithfully represent true patterns of host or vector distribution and movements. As a foundation for future modeling and parameter estimation, we evaluated potential influences of distribution and movements of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) on the spatial epidemiology of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in north-central Colorado. We used cluster techniques to define mule deer population units based on location data, and then used these as the sampling unit for subsequent analyses. We found marked differences in prevalence between population units that appeared at least partially related to deer movements. Migration (mean migration rate = 44\%) rather than dispersal movements (\&\#x2264;2\% dispersal rate) appeared the most likely mechanism for disease spread among population units. Analysis of exchange matrices coupled with prevalence differentials between population units indicated that a single source of CWD was unlikely in north-central Colorado. Using anthropogenic boundaries (such as counties or game management units) to define sample units rather than population units could have obscured the potential role of deer movement in the spatial epidemiology of CWD. Using population units or subpopulations as the sample unit and including movements at this scale are broadly applicable approaches for spatial epidemiology.},

Broadly, the approach involves measuring genetic variation, quantifying landscape heterogeneity, and statistically testing the link between both genetic variation and landscape heterogeneity. This approach has been widely used by conservation biologists, for example to identify barriers restricting movement in threatened populations. More recently, landscape genetics has been used to study the epidemiology of infectious diseases, such as chronic wasting disease, raccoon rabies, and malaria. This method can be useful to identifying potential hotspot areas of disease movement for targeted public health interventions and containment of disease and drug resistance. However, vector-borne disease epidemiology is particularly complex, as it is affected by the movement of both the vector and human or vertebrate host. This feature could potentially inhibit the ability to detect the effect of landscape on gene flow, since the ecology of vectors and hosts are likely different and potentially conflicting. Here, we provide a summary of the latest innovations in the field of landscape genetics with a focus on those that could help increase the power to detect landscape effects in vector-borne human disease studies. We also provide a recommended framework for studying vector-borne diseases using a landscape genetics approach. Landscape genetics has the potential to be a powerful tool for the field of vector-borne disease epidemiology, but has so far been underutilized.

We characterized the spatial distribution of CWD in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Wisconsin to facilitate CWD management. We found that CWD prevalence declined with distance from a central location, was locally correlated at a scale of 3.6 km, and was correlated with deer habitat abundance. The latter result is consistent with patterns expected for a positive relationship between density and prevalence of CWD. We recommend management activities focused on culling in geographic areas with high prevalence to have the greatest probability of removing infected individuals.

In particular, biotic factors, such as predation and vegetation, including those resulting from anthropogenic land-use change, are underrepresented in species distribution modeling, but could improve model predictions. Using generalized linear models and model selection techniques, we used 129 estimates of population density of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) from 5 continents to evaluate the relative importance, magnitude, and direction of biotic and abiotic factors in predicting population density of an invasive large mammal with a global distribution. Incorporating diverse biotic factors, including agriculture, vegetation cover, and large carnivore richness, into species distribution modeling substantially improved model fit and predictions. Abiotic factors, including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, were also important predictors. The predictive map of population density revealed wide-ranging potential for an invasive large mammal to expand its distribution globally. This information can be used to proactively create conservation/management plans to control future invasions. Our study demonstrates that the ongoing paradigm shift, which recognizes that both biotic and abiotic factors shape species distributions across broad scales, can be advanced by incorporating diverse biotic factors.},

There is, however, a cost to using the N-mixture models: inference is very sensitive to the model's assumptions. We consider the effects of three violations of assumptions which might reasonably be expected in practice: double counting, unmodeled variation in population size over time, and unmodeled variation in detection probability over time. These three examples show that small violations of assumptions can lead to large biases in estimation. The violations of assumptions we consider are not only small qualitatively, but are also small in the sense that they are unlikely to be detected using goodness-of-fit tests. In cases where reliable estimates of population size are needed, we encourage investigators to allocate resources to acquiring additional data, such as recaptures of marked individuals, for estimation of detection probabilities.

  abstract = {Ungulates are key components in ecosystems and economically important for sport and subsistence harvest. Yet the relative importance of the effects of weather conditions, forage productivity, and carnivores on ungulates are not well understood. We examined changes in elk (Cervus canadensis) recruitment (indexed as age ratios) across 7 states and 3 ecotypes in the northwestern United States during 1989\textendash{}2010, while considering the effects of predator richness, forage productivity, and precipitation. We found a broad-scale, long-term decrease in elk recruitment of 0.48 juveniles/100 adult females/year. Weather conditions (indexed as summer and winter precipitation) showed small, but measurable, influences on recruitment. Forage productivity on summer and winter ranges (indexed by normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI] metrics) had the strongest effect on elk recruitment relative to other factors. Relationships between forage productivity and recruitment varied seasonally and regionally. The productivity of winter habitat was more important in southern parts of the study area, whereas annual variation in productivity of summer habitat had more influence on recruitment in northern areas. Elk recruitment varied by up to 15 juveniles/100 adult females across the range of variation in forage productivity. Areas with more species of large carnivores had relatively low elk recruitment, presumably because of increased predation. Wolves (Canis lupus) were associated with a decrease of 5 juveniles/100 adult females, whereas grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) were associated with an additional decrease of 7 juveniles/100 adult females. Carnivore species can have a critical influence on ungulate recruitment because their influence rivals large ranges of variation in environmental conditions. A more pressing concern, however, stems from persistent broad-scale decreases in recruitment across the distribution of elk in the northwestern United States, irrespective of carnivore richness. Our results suggest that wildlife managers interested in improving recruitment of elk consider the combined effects of habitat and predators. Efforts to manage summer and winter ranges to increase forage productivity may have a positive effect on recruitment. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Wildlife Society. We examined elk recruitment across 7 states in the western United States and demonstrated that elk recruitment is generally declining across the region. Forage productivity and presence of wolves and grizzly bears correlated with changes in recruitment, but the general decline existed with and without wolves and grizzly bears.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal disease of North American cervids that was first detected in a wild, hunter-shot deer in Saskatchewan along the border with Alberta in Canada in 2000. Spatially explicit models for assessing factors affecting disease detection are needed to guide surveillance and control programs. Spatio-temporal patterns in CWD prevalence can be complicated by variation in individual infection probability and sampling biases. We assessed hunter harvest data of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) during the early phases of an outbreak in Saskatchewan (i.e., 2002\textendash{}2007) for targeting the detection of CWD by defining (1) where to look, and (2) how much effort to use. First, we accounted for known demographic heterogeneities in infection to model the probability, PE, that a harvested deer was infected with CWD given characteristics of the harvest location. Second, in areas where infected deer were harvested we modelled the probability, PD, of the hunter harvest re-detecting CWD within sample units of varying size (9\textendash{}54km2) given the demographics of harvested deer and time since first detection in the study area. Heterogeneities in host infection were consistent with those reported elsewhere: mule deer 3.7 times $>$white-tailed deer, males 1.8 times$>$females, and quadratically related to age in both sexes. PE increased with number of years since the first detection in our study area (2002) and proximity to known disease sources, and also varied with distance to the South Saskatchewan River and small creek drainages, terrain ruggedness, and extent of agriculture lands within a 3km radius of the harvest. The majority (75\%) of new CWD-positive deer from our sample were found within 20km of infected deer harvested in the previous year, while approximately 10\% were greater than 40km. PD modelled at 18km2 was best supported, but for all scales, PD depended on the number of harvested deer and time since the first infected deer was harvested. Within an 18km2 sampling unit, there was an 80\% probability of detecting a CWD-positive deer with 16 harvested deer five years after the initial infected harvest. Identifying where and how much to sample to detect CWD can improve targeted surveillance programs early in the outbreak of the disease when based on hunter harvest.},

The intervention consisted of measures of deer removal from three deer population control programs: Illinois Department of Natural Resources culling, deer population control permits and nuisance deer removal permits. We included in the analysis a total of 14,650 white-tailed deer CWD test results. These data also included location and demographic data collected from both deer harvested in the interventions as well as deer from hunter harvests and deer vehicle collisions. We quantified intervention pressures as the number of years of intervention, the total number of deer removed and the average number of deer removed per year. We accounted for temporal and spatial variations of intervention by using mixed logistic regression to model the association between intervention pressures and CWD prevalence change. The results showed that deer population management intervention as practiced in Illinois during the study period was negatively associated with CWD prevalence and the strength of association varied depending on age of deer and the measure of intervention pressure. The population management programs showed a more consistent association with reduced CWD prevalence in fawn and yearling white-tailed deer than in adult deer. Our results also suggested that frequent and continuing intervention events with at least moderate intensity of culling were needed to reduce CWD prevalence. A longer study period, however, is needed to make a more definite conclusion about the effectiveness of similar population management programs for controlling CWD in wild white-tailed deer.},

This is exemplified in western Wyoming where institutional feeding over the past century has aimed to mitigate wildlife\textendash{}livestock conflict and minimize winter mortality of elk (Cervus canadensis). Here we review research across 23 winter feedgrounds where the most studied disease is brucellosis, caused by the bacterium Brucella abortus. Traditional veterinary practices (vaccination, test-and-slaughter) have thus far been unable to control this disease in elk, which can spill over to cattle. Current disease-reduction efforts are being guided by ecological research on elk movement and density, reproduction, stress, co-infections and scavengers. Given the right tools, feedgrounds could provide opportunities for adaptive management of brucellosis through regular animal testing and population-level manipulations. Our analyses of several such manipulations highlight the value of a research\textendash{}management partnership guided by hypothesis testing, despite the constraints of the sociopolitical environment. However, brucellosis is now spreading in unfed elk herds, while other diseases (e.g. chronic wasting disease) are of increasing concern at feedgrounds. Therefore experimental closures of feedgrounds, reduced feeding and lower elk populations merit consideration.This article is part of the theme issue `Anthropogenic resource subsidies and host\textendash{}parasite dynamics in wildlife'.},

Moreover, we demonstrate here that CWD prions are transmitted from doe to fawn. Maternal CWD infection also appears to result in lower percentage of live birth offspring. In addition, evolving evidence from protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) assays on fetal tissues suggest that covert prion infection occurs in utero. Overall, our findings demonstrate that transmission of prions from mother to offspring can occur, and may be underestimated for all prion diseases.},

Migratory birds depend on broad-scale weather patterns to inform timing of movements, but may be more susceptible to local weather patterns during sedentary periods. We constructed Bayesian integrated population models (IPMs) to assess whether continental or local weather effects best explained population dynamics in an environmentally sensitive aerial insectivorous bird, the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), along a transcontinental gradient from British Columbia to Saskatchewan to New York, and tested whether population dynamics were synchronous among sites. Little consistency existed among sites in the demographic rates most affecting population growth rate or in correlations among rates. Juvenile apparent survival at all sites was stable over time and greatest in New York, whereas adult apparent survival was more variable among years and sites, and greatest in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Fledging success was greatest in Saskatchewan. Local weather conditions explained significant variation in adult survival in Saskatchewan and fledging success in New York, corroborating the hypothesis that local more than continental weather drives the population dynamics of this species and, therefore, demographic synchrony measured at three sites was limited. Nonetheless, multi-population IPMs can be a powerful tool for identifying correlated population trajectories caused by synchronous demographic rates, and can pinpoint the scale at which environmental drivers are responsible for changes. We caution against applying uniform conservation actions for populations where synchrony does not occur or is not fully understood.},

  abstract = {Movement is a key mean for mobile species to cope with heterogeneous environments. While in herbivorous mammals large-scale migration has been widely investigated, fine-scale movement responses to local variations in resources and predation risk remain much less studied, especially in savannah environments. We developed a novel approach based on complementary movement metrics (residence time, frequency of visits and regularity of visits) to relate movement patterns of a savannah grazer, the blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, to fine-scale variations in food availability, predation risk and water availability in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Wildebeests spent more time in grazing lawns where the grass is of higher quality but shorter than in seep zones, where the grass is of lower quality but more abundant. Although the daily distances moved were longer during the wet season compared to the dry season, the daily net displacement was lower, and the residence time higher, indicating a more frequent occurrence of area-concentred searching. In contrast, during the late dry season the foraging sessions were more fragmented and wildebeests moved more frequently between foraging areas. Surprisingly, predation risk appeared to be the second factor, after water availability, influencing movement during the dry season, when resources are limiting and thus expected to influence movement more. Our approach, using complementary analyses of different movement metrics, provided an integrated view of changes in individual movement with varying environmental conditions and predation risk. It makes it possible to highlight the adaptive behavioral decisions made by wildebeest to cope with unpredictable environmental variations and provides insights for population conservation.},

Comparison of the values of the log-likelihood functions at their maxima allowed discrimination between the two models (hypotheses). Extensive Monte Carlo studies were made on the performance of the discriminant test and the power of the test under the two extreme hypotheses and a range of intermediate hypotheses. The results of the discriminant tests on the data agreed closely with the expected performance of the test if the true underlying process was compensatory.

  issn = {00129658, 19399170},
  abstract = {[Models of population dynamics are frequently used for purposes such as testing hypotheses about density dependence and predicting species' responses to future environmental change or conservation actions. Fitting models of population dynamics to field data is challenging because most data sets are characterized by observation error, which can inflate estimates of process variation if ignored. Recently, state-space models have been developed to deal with this problem by directly modeling both the observation error and the ecological process of interest. Conventional state-space models, however, have several important limitations: (1) they assume that random effects are Gaussian distributed, which implies that abundance can be negative and that false positive observation errors are equally likely as false negative errors; (2) they do not admit spatial variation in population dynamics; and (3) some of the parameters of the model are not estimable. We demonstrate how each of these problems can be resolved using a class of hierarchical models proposed by Dail and Madsen (2011) that attributes observation error to imperfect detection. We expand this class of models to accommodate classical growth models (e. g., exponential and Ricker-logistic), zero-inflation, and random effects. We also present methods for forecasting population size under future environmental conditions. Implementation of these ideas is possible using either frequentist or Bayesian methods, as demonstrated by accompanying R and JAGS code. Results of a simulation study suggest that bias is negligible and coverage nominal in most cases for the proposed model extensions. An analysis of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey highlights how these methods can be readily applied to existing data, but it also suggests that precision will be low when direct information about detection probability (such as is collected using distance sampling or replicated counts) is lacking.]},

  abstract = {Recent localized declines in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations in the southeastern United States have been linked to increasing predation pressure from coyotes (Canis latrans), a novel predator to the region. Studies have documented coyotes as the leading cause of mortality for neonates, and 1 study documented coyotes as a mortality factor for adult females. However, no study has used field-based vital rates to conduct sensitivity analyses or model deer population trajectories under potential harvest or predator removal strategies. We used low, medium, and high values of fawn survival, adult female survival, and fecundity data collected from Fort Bragg Military Installation, North Carolina to demonstrate the current declining population trajectory for deer ($\lambda$\,=\,0.905; low $\lambda$\,=\,0.788, high $\lambda$\,=\,1.003). Consistent with other studies of ungulates, we determined adult female survival was the most sensitive and elastic vital rate. Further, for 3 potential management (``what if'') scenarios, we projected the population for 10 years using estimated vital rates. Reducing adult female harvest ($\lambda$\,=\,0.935; low $\lambda$\,=\,0.875, high $\lambda$\,=\,1.002) and coyote removal ($\lambda$\,=\,0.995; low $\lambda$\,=\,0.898, high $\lambda$\,=\,1.081) reduced the current population decline, whereas combining both approaches ($\lambda$\,=\,1.024; low $\lambda$\,=\,0.898, high $\lambda$\,=\,1.141) resulted in population increases. Our data indicate that for low-density deer populations with heavy predation pressure on neonates, protecting adult females from harvest may not completely offset population declines. Coyote removal might be a necessary strategy because it could possibly increase very low fawn survival, which appears to be the most important vital rate influencing $\lambda$ in our study. However, managers may have to start with reductions in adult female harvest because coyote removal would have to be continuous and consistently effective, making it an impractical management approach by itself. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Here, we examine common issues in ecological modelling and suggest criteria for improving modelling frameworks. An appropriate level of process description is crucial to constructing the best possible model, given the available data and understanding of ecological structures. Model details unsupported by data typically lead to over parameterisation and poor model performance. Conversely, a lack of mechanistic details may limit a model's ability to predict ecological systems' responses to management. Ecological studies that employ models should follow a set of model adequacy assessment protocols that include: asking a series of critical questions regarding state and control variable selection, the determinacy of data, and the sensitivity and validity of analyses. We also need to improve model elaboration, refinement and coarse graining procedures to better understand the relevancy and adequacy of our models and the role they play in advancing theory, improving hind and forecasting, and enabling problem solving and management.},

  abstract = {Ecological data often exhibit spatial pattern, which can be modeled as autocorrelation. Conditional autoregressive (CAR) and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models are network-based models (also known as graphical models) specifically designed to model spatially autocorrelated data based on neighborhood relationships. We identify and discuss six different types of practical ecological inference using CAR and SAR models, including: (1) model selection, (2) spatial regression, (3) estimation of autocorrelation, (4) estimation of other connectivity parameters, (5) spatial prediction, and (6) spatial smoothing. We compare CAR and SAR models, showing their development and connection to partial correlations. Special cases, such as the intrinsic autoregressive model (IAR), are described. Conditional autoregressive and SAR models depend on weight matrices, whose practical development uses neighborhood definition and row-standardization. Weight matrices can also include ecological covariates and connectivity structures, which we emphasize, but have been rarely used. Trends in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in southeastern Alaska from 463 polygons, some with missing data, are used to illustrate the six inference types. We develop a variety of weight matrices and CAR and SAR spatial regression models are fit using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Profile likelihood graphs illustrate inference for covariance parameters. The same data set is used for both prediction and smoothing, and the relative merits of each are discussed. We show the nonstationary variances and correlations of a CAR model and demonstrate the effect of row-standardization. We include several take-home messages for CAR and SAR models, including (1) choosing between CAR and IAR models, (2) modeling ecological effects in the covariance matrix, (3) the appeal of spatial smoothing, and (4) how to handle isolated neighbors. We highlight several reasons why ecologists will want to make use of autoregressive models, both directly and in hierarchical models, and not only in explicit spatial settings, but also for more general connectivity models.},

However, continuous-time models capable of mimicking realistic trajectories with sufficient detail are computationally challenging to fit to large datasets. Furthermore, basic continuous-time model specifications (e.g. Brownian motion) lack realism in their ability to capture nonstationary dynamics. We present a unified class of animal movement models that are computationally efficient and provide a suite of approaches for accommodating nonstationarity in continuous trajectories due to migration and interactions among individuals. Our approach uses process convolutions to allow for flexibility in the movement process while facilitating implementation and incorporating location uncertainty. We show how to nest convolution models to incorporate interactions among migrating individuals to account for nonstationarity and provide inference about dynamic migratory networks. We demonstrate these approaches in two case studies involving migratory birds. Specifically, we used process convolution models with temporal deformation to account for heterogeneity in individual greater white-fronted goose migrations in Europe and Iceland, and we used nested process convolutions to model dynamic migratory networks in sandhill cranes in North America. The approach we present accounts for various forms of temporal heterogeneity in animal movement and is not limited to migratory applications. Furthermore, our models rely on well-established principles for modelling-dependent data and leverage modern approaches for modelling dynamic networks to help explain animal movement and social interaction.},

  abstract = {Integral projection models (IPMs) use information on how an individual's state influences its vital rates \textendash{} survival, growth and reproduction \textendash{} to make population projections. IPMs are constructed from regression models predicting vital rates from state variables (e.g. size or age) and covariates (e.g. environment). By combining regressions of vital rates, an IPM provides mechanistic insight into emergent ecological patterns such as population dynamics, species geographic distributions or life-history strategies.Here, we review important resources for building IPMs and provide a comprehensive guide, with extensive R code, for their construction. IPMs can be applied to any stage-structured population; here, we illustrate IPMs for a series of plant life histories of increasing complexity and biological realism, highlighting the utility of various regression methods for capturing biological patterns. We also present case studies illustrating how IPMs can be used to predict species' geographic distributions and life-history strategies.IPMs can represent a wide range of life histories at any desired level of biological detail. Much of the strength of IPMs lies in the strength of regression models. Many subtleties arise when scaling from vital rate regressions to population-level patterns, so we provide a set of diagnostics and guidelines to ensure that models are biologically plausible. Moreover, IPMs can exploit a large existing suite of analytical tools developed for matrix projection models.},

  abstract = {Conservation and management of spatially structured populations is challenging because solutions must consider where individuals are located, but also differential individual space use as a result of landscape heterogeneity. A recent extension of spatial capture\textendash{}recapture (SCR) models, the ecological distance model, uses spatial encounter histories of individuals (e.g., a record of where individuals are detected across space, often sequenced over multiple sampling occasions), to estimate the relationship between space use and characteristics of a landscape, allowing simultaneous estimation of both local densities of individuals across space and connectivity at the scale of individual movement. We developed two model-based estimators derived from the SCR ecological distance model to quantify connectivity over a continuous surface: (1) potential connectivity\textemdash{}a metric of the connectivity of areas based on resistance to individual movement; and (2) density-weighted connectivity (DWC)\textemdash{}potential connectivity weighted by estimated density. Estimates of potential connectivity and DWC can provide spatial representations of areas that are most important for the conservation of threatened species, or management of abundant populations (i.e., areas with high density and landscape connectivity), and thus generate predictions that have great potential to inform conservation and management actions. We used a simulation study with a stationary trap design across a range of landscape resistance scenarios to evaluate how well our model estimates resistance, potential connectivity, and DWC. Correlation between true and estimated potential connectivity was high, and there was positive correlation and high spatial accuracy between estimated DWC and true DWC. We applied our approach to data collected from a population of black bears in New York, and found that forested areas represented low levels of resistance for black bears. We demonstrate that formal inference about measures of landscape connectivity can be achieved from standard methods of studying animal populations which yield individual encounter history data such as camera trapping. Resulting biological parameters including resistance, potential connectivity, and DWC estimate the spatial distribution and connectivity of the population within a statistical framework, and we outline applications to many possible conservation and management problems.},

  doi = {10.1111/2041-210X.12316},
  abstract = {Summary Movement is influenced by landscape structure, configuration and geometry, but measuring distance as perceived by animals poses technical and logistical challenges. Instead, movement is typically measured using Euclidean distance, irrespective of location or landscape structure, or is based on arbitrary cost surfaces. A recently proposed extension of spatial capture?recapture (SCR) models resolves this issue using spatial encounter histories of individuals to calculate least?cost paths (ecological distance: Ecology, 94, 2013, 287) thereby relaxing the Euclidean assumption. We evaluate the consequences of not accounting for movement heterogeneity when estimating abundance in highly structured landscapes, and demonstrate the value of this approach for estimating biologically realistic space?use patterns and landscape connectivity. We simulated SCR data in a riparian habitat network, using the ecological distance model under a range of scenarios where space?use in and around the landscape was increasingly associated with water (i.e. increasingly less Euclidean). To assess the influence of miscalculating distance on estimates of population size, we compared the results from the ecological and Euclidean distance based models. We then demonstrate that the ecological distance model can be used to estimate home range geometry when space use is not symmetrical. Finally, we provide a method for calculating landscape connectivity based on modelled species?landscape interactions generated from capture?recapture data. Using ecological distance always produced unbiased estimates of abundance. Explicitly modelling the strength of the species?landscape interaction provided a direct measure of landscape connectivity and better characterised true home range geometry. Abundance under the Euclidean distance model was increasingly (negatively) biased as space use was more strongly associated with water and, because home ranges are assumed to be symmetrical, produced poor characterisations of home range geometry and no information about landscape connectivity. The ecological distance SCR model uses spatially indexed capture?recapture data to estimate how activity patterns are influenced by landscape structure. As well as reducing bias in estimates of abundance, this approach provides biologically realistic representations of home range geometry, and direct information about species?landscape interactions. The incorporation of both structural (landscape) and functional (movement) components of connectivity provides a direct measure of species?specific landscape connectivity.},

Recent changes in both climate and vertebrate community assemblages have created a unique opportunity to examine the impacts of two dynamic forces on population regulation. We examined the effects of warming winter conditions and the reestablishment of a previously extirpated predator, the fisher (Martes pennanti), on regulatory mechanisms in a northern-adapted mammal, the porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), along their southern range boundary. Using a long-term (17-year) capture\textendash{}recapture data set, we (1) quantified the impacts of climate change and increased fisher predation on the survival of adult porcupines at their regional southern terminus, (2) assessed recruitment (via both adult fecundity and juvenile survival) of porcupines, and (3) modeled the relative importance of predation and winter conditions on the demography and population growth rate ($\lambda$). Severe winters and abundant predators interacted synergistically to reduce adult survivorship by as much as 44\%, while expanding predator populations led to near reproductive failure among porcupines. Increasing predatory pressure, disruptions in this community module, and more frequent extreme winter weather events led to predicted extirpation within 50 years, whereas in the absence of predators, the population was viable. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding behind distributional shifts resulting from climate change and may be broadly relevant for predicting future distributional shifts in other northern-adapted mammalian species.},

  doi = {10.1111/brv.12409},
  abstract = {Increasingly imperative objectives in ecology are to understand and forecast population dynamic and evolutionary responses to seasonal environmental variation and change. Such population and evolutionary dynamics result from immediate and lagged responses of all key life-history traits, and resulting demographic rates that affect population growth rate, to seasonal environmental conditions and population density. However, existing population dynamic and eco-evolutionary theory and models have not yet fully encompassed within-individual and among-individual variation, covariation, structure and heterogeneity, and ongoing evolution, in a critical life-history trait that allows individuals to respond to seasonal environmental conditions: seasonal migration. Meanwhile, empirical studies aided by new animal-tracking technologies are increasingly demonstrating substantial within-population variation in the occurrence and form of migration versus year-round residence, generating diverse forms of `partial migration' spanning diverse species, habitats and spatial scales. Such partially migratory systems form a continuum between the extreme scenarios of full migration and full year-round residence, and are commonplace in nature. Here, we first review basic scenarios of partial migration and associated models designed to identify conditions that facilitate the maintenance of migratory polymorphism. We highlight that such models have been fundamental to the development of partial migration theory, but are spatially and demographically simplistic compared to the rich bodies of population dynamic theory and models that consider spatially structured populations with dispersal but no migration, or consider populations experiencing strong seasonality and full obligate migration. Second, to provide an overarching conceptual framework for spatio-temporal population dynamics, we define a `partially migratory meta-population' system as a spatially structured set of locations that can be occupied by different sets of resident and migrant individuals in different seasons, and where locations that can support reproduction can also be linked by dispersal. We outline key forms of within-individual and among-individual variation and structure in migration that could arise within such systems and interact with variation in individual survival, reproduction and dispersal to create complex population dynamics and evolutionary responses across locations, seasons, years and generations. Third, we review approaches by which population dynamic and eco-evolutionary models could be developed to test hypotheses regarding the dynamics and persistence of partially migratory meta-populations given diverse forms of seasonal environmental variation and change, and to forecast system-specific dynamics. To demonstrate one such approach, we use an evolutionary individual-based model to illustrate that multiple forms of partial migration can readily co-exist in a simple spatially structured landscape. Finally, we summarise recent empirical studies that demonstrate key components of demographic structure in partial migration, and demonstrate diverse associations with reproduction and survival. We thereby identify key theoretical and empirical knowledge gaps that remain, and consider multiple complementary approaches by which these gaps can be filled in order to elucidate population dynamic and eco-evolutionary responses to spatio-temporal seasonal environmental variation and change.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.017},
  abstract = {Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, source-sink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences.},

  doi = {10.1002/ece3.3685},
  abstract = {Variation in movement across time and space fundamentally shapes the abundance and distribution of populations. Although a variety of approaches model structured population dynamics, they are limited to specific types of spatially structured populations and lack a unifying framework. Here, we propose a unified network-based framework sufficiently novel in its flexibility to capture a wide variety of spatiotemporal processes including metapopulations and a range of migratory patterns. It can accommodate different kinds of age structures, forms of population growth, dispersal, nomadism and migration, and alternative life-history strategies. Our objective was to link three general elements common to all spatially structured populations (space, time and movement) under a single mathematical framework. To do this, we adopt a network modeling approach. The spatial structure of a population is represented by a weighted and directed network. Each node and each edge has a set of attributes which vary through time. The dynamics of our network-based population is modeled with discrete time steps. Using both theoretical and real-world examples, we show how common elements recur across species with disparate movement strategies and how they can be combined under a unified mathematical framework. We illustrate how metapopulations, various migratory patterns, and nomadism can be represented with this modeling approach. We also apply our network-based framework to four organisms spanning a wide range of life histories, movement patterns, and carrying capacities. General computer code to implement our framework is provided, which can be applied to almost any spatially structured population. This framework contributes to our theoretical understanding of population dynamics and has practical management applications, including understanding the impact of perturbations on population size, distribution, and movement patterns. By working within a common framework, there is less chance that comparative analyses are colored by model details rather than general principles.},

Our key results are that male-male and between-sex networks are structured at broader spatial scales than female-female networks and that in male-male and between-sex contact networks, but not female-female networks, there is a significant relationship between infection and contacts with individuals in other groups. These sex differences in social behaviour may underpin male-biased acquisition of infection and may result in males being responsible for more between-group transmission.

We propose a conceptual framework for personality-dependent spatial ecology. We link expectations derived from the movement ecology paradigm with behavioural reaction-norms to offer specific predictions on the interactions between environmental factors, such as resource distribution or landscape structure, and intrinsic behavioural variation. We consider how environmental heterogeneity and individual consistency in movements that carry-over across spatial scales can lead to personality-dependent: (1) foraging search performance; (2) habitat preference; (3) home range utilization patterns; (4) social network structure and (5) emergence of assortative population structure with spatial clusters of personalities. We support our conceptual model with spatially explicit simulations of behavioural variation in space-use, demonstrating the emergence of complex population-level patterns from differences in simple individual-level behaviours. Consideration of consistent individual variation in space-use will facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive social, spatial, ecological and evolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous environments.},

  abstract = {The conservation of wildlife requires management based on quantitative evidence, and especially for large carnivores, unraveling cause-specific mortalities and understanding their impact on population dynamics is crucial. Acquiring this knowledge is challenging because it is difficult to obtain robust long-term data sets on endangered populations and, usually, data are collected through diverse sampling strategies. Integrated population models (IPMs) offer a way to integrate data generated through different processes. However, IPMs are female-based models that cannot account for mate availability, and this feature limits their applicability to monogamous species only. We extended classical IPMs to a two-sex framework that allows investigation of population dynamics and quantification of cause-specific mortality rates in nonmonogamous species. We illustrated our approach by simultaneously modeling different types of data from a reintroduced, unhunted brown bear (Ursus arctos) population living in an area with a dense human population. In a population mainly driven by adult survival, we estimated that on average 11\% of cubs and 61\% of adults died from human-related causes. Although the population is currently not at risk, adult survival and thus population dynamics are driven by anthropogenic mortality. Given the recent increase of human-bear conflicts in the area, removal of individuals for management purposes and through poaching may increase, reversing the positive population growth rate. Our approach can be generalized to other species affected by cause-specific mortality and will be useful to inform conservation decisions for other nonmonogamous species, such as most large carnivores, for which data are scarce and diverse and thus data integration is highly desirable.

However, the source(s) of infectious prions in these body fluids has yet to be identified. In the present study, we analyzed tissues proximate to saliva, urine, and fecal production by sPMCA in an attempt to elucidate this unique aspect of CWD pathogenesis. Oropharyngeal, urogenital, and gastrointestinal tissues along with blood and obex from CWD-exposed cervids (comprising 27 animals and $>$350 individual samples) were analyzed and scored based on the apparent relative CWD burden. PrPCWD-generating activity was detected in a range of tissues and was highest in the salivary gland, urinary bladder, and distal intestinal tract. In the same assays, blood from the same animals and unseeded normal brain homogenate controls (n = 116 of 117) remained negative. The PrP-converting activity in peripheral tissues varied from 10-11- to 100-fold of that found in brain of the same animal. Deer with highest levels of PrPCWD amplification in the brain had higher and more widely disseminated prion amplification in excretory tissues. Interestingly, PrPCWD was not demonstrable in these excretory tissues by conventional Western blotting, suggesting a low prion burden or the presence of protease-sensitive infectious prions destroyed by harsh proteolytic treatments. These findings offer unique insights into the transmission of CWD in particular and prion infection and trafficking overall.},

To address the question of relevance in a naturally exposed free-ranging population, we assessed maternal and fetal tissues derived from 19 elk dam\textendash{}calf pairs collected from free-ranging Rocky Mountain elk from north-central Colorado, a known CWD endemic region. Conventional immunohistochemistry identified three of 19 CWD-positive dams, whereas a more sensitive assay [serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA)] detected CWD prion seeding activity (PrPCWD) in 15 of 19 dams. PrPCWD distribution in tissues was widespread, and included the central nervous system (CNS), lymphoreticular system, and reproductive, secretory, excretory and adipose tissues. Interestingly, five of 15 sPMCA-positive dams showed no evidence of PrPCWD in either CNS or lymphoreticular system, sites typically assessed in diagnosing CWD. Analysis of fetal tissues harvested from the 15 sPMCA-positive dams revealed PrPCWD in 80\,\% of fetuses (12 of 15), regardless of gestational stage. These findings demonstrated that PrPCWD is more abundant in peripheral tissues of CWD-exposed elk than current diagnostic methods suggest, and that transmission of prions from mother to offspring may contribute to the efficient transmission of CWD in naturally exposed cervid populations.},

  abstract = {An unidentified environmental reservoir of infectivity contributes to the natural transmission of prion diseases (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies [TSEs]) in sheep, deer, and elk.  Prion infectivity may enter soil environments via shedding from diseased animals and decomposition of infected carcasses.  Burial of TSE-infected cattle, sheep, and deer as a means of disposal has resulted in unintentional introduction of prions into subsurface environments.  We examined the potential for soil to serve as a TSE reservoir by studying the interaction of the disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc) with common soil minerals.  In this study, we demonstrated substantial PrPSc adsorption to two clay minerals, quartz, and four whole soil samples.  We quantified the PrPSc-binding capacities of each mineral.  Furthermore, we observed that PrPSc desorbed from montmorillonite clay was cleaved at an N-terminal site and the interaction between PrPSc and Mte was strong, making desorption of the protein difficult.  Despite cleavage and avid binding, PrPSc bound to Mte remained infectious.  Results from our study suggest that PrPSc released into soil environments may be preserved in a bioavailable form, perpetuating prion disease epizootics and exposing other species to the infectious agent.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a horizontally transmissible prion disease of free ranging deer, elk and moose. Recent experimental transmission studies indicate caribou are also susceptible to the disease. CWD is present in southeast Alberta and southern Saskatchewan. This CWD-endemic region is expanding, threatening Manitoba and areas of northern Alberta and Saskatchewan, home to caribou. Soil can serve as a stable reservoir for infectious prion proteins; prions bound to soil particles remain infectious in the soils for many years. Soils of western Canada are very diverse and the ability of CWD prions to bind different soils and the impact of this interaction on infectivity is not known. In general, clay-rich soils may bind prions avidly and enhance their infectivity comparable to pure clay mineral montmorillonite. Organic components of soils are also diverse and not well characterized, yet can impact prion-soil interaction. Other important contributing factors include soil pH, composition of soil solution and amount of metals (metal oxides). In this review, properties of soils of the CWD-endemic region in western Canada with its surrounding terrestrial environment are described and used to predict bioavailability and, thus, potential spread of CWD. The major soils in the CWD-endemic region of Alberta and Saskatchewan are Chernozems, present in 60\% of the total area; they are generally similar in texture, clay mineralogy and soil organic matter content, and can be characterized as clay loamy, montmorillonite (smectite) soils with 6\textendash{}10\% organic carbon. The greatest risk of CWD spread in western Canada relates to clay loamy, montmorillonite soils with humus horizon. Such soils are predominant in the southern region of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, but are less common in northern regions of the provinces where quartz-illite sandy soils with low amount of humus prevail.},

Prions are the protein-based infectious agents responsible for prion diseases. Environmental prion contamination has been implicated in disease transmission. Here, we analyzed the binding and retention of infectious prion protein (PrPSc) to plants. Small quantities of PrPSc contained in diluted brain homogenate or in excretory materials (urine and feces) can bind to wheat grass roots and leaves. Wild-type hamsters were efficiently infected by ingestion of prion-contaminated plants. The prion-plant interaction occurs with prions from diverse origins, including chronic wasting disease. Furthermore, leaves contaminated by spraying with a prion-containing preparation retained PrPSc for several weeks in the living plant. Finally, plants can uptake prions from contaminated soil and transport them to aerial parts of the plant (stem and leaves). These findings demonstrate that plants can efficiently bind infectious prions and act as carriers of infectivity, suggesting a possible role of environmental prion contamination in the horizontal transmission of the disease.},

Animals habitually ingest soil, and results from laboratory experiments demonstrate prions can bind to a wide range of soils and soil minerals, retain the ability to replicate, and remain infectious, indicating soil could serve as a reservoir for natural prion transmission and a potential prion exposure route for humans. Preliminary epidemiological modeling suggests soil texture may influence the incidence of prion disease. These results are supported by experimental work demonstrating variance in prion interactions with soil, including variance in prion soil adsorption and soil-bound prion replication with respect to soil type. Thus, local soil type may be a key determinant of prion incidence. Further experimental and epidemiological work is required to fully elucidate the dynamics of soil-mediated prion transmission, an effort that should lead to effective disease management and mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are fatal, infectious neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and other mammals. The etiological agent in TSEs is the prion and is thought to be composed of aggregated, b-sheet-rich conformers of the prion protein (PrPTSE) derived from misfolding of a benign cellular form of the same protein. Prions are remarkably resistant to inactivation and can persist and remain infectious in the environment for years. Environmental routes of TSE transmission are implicated in chronic wasting disease (CWD) of deer, elk and moose and in scrapie of sheep and goats. Soil is thought to be an important reservoir of CWD and scrapie infectivity. The extent to which prions are inactivated by natural processes in soils is unclear, and methods for inactivating TSE agents in soil are currently lacking. This critical review discusses current knowledge on the degradation of PrPTSE and inactivation of prions by individual bacterial species, mixed microbial consortia, and isolated bacterial and archaeal enzymes, and highlights areas warranting further research. Research conducted to date indicates that few microorganisms are able to degrade PrPTSE. Fungi have not been evaluated for their ability to inactivate TSE agents. Of proteases reported to degrade PrPTSE, most are serine proteases and many require harsh conditions (e.g., elevated temperature, high pH, detergent) for optimal PrPTSEdegrading activity. Declines in the levels of PrPTSE are not always accompanied by equivalent decreases in TSE infectivity. Most biodegradation studies reported to date did not examine effects on TSE infectivity and must therefore be considered inconclusive with respect to the likely impact on prion disease transmission. Improved understanding of the factors affecting prion inactivation is required to discern natural routes of prion inactivation or implement effective practices outside of the laboratory.},

  abstract = {The environment plays a key role in horizontal transmission of prion diseases, since prions are extremely resistant to classical inactivation procedures. In prior work, we observed the high stability of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) infectivity when these prions were incubated in aqueous media such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or wastewater for nearly nine months. As a continuation of this experiment, the same samples were maintained in PBS or wastewater for five additional years and residual BSE infectivity was assessed in bovine PrPC transgenic mice. Over this long time period (more than six years), BSE infectivity was reduced by three and one orders of magnitude in wastewater and PBS respectively. To rule out a possible agent specific effect, sheep scrapie prions were subjected to the same experimental protocol, using eight years as the experimental end-point. No significant reduction in scrapie infectivity was observed over the first nine months of wastewater incubation while PBS incubation for eight years only produced a two logarithmic unit reduction in infectivity. By contrast, the dynamics of PrPRes persistence was different, disappearing progressively over the first year. The long persistence of prion infectivity observed in this study for two different agents provides supporting evidence of the assumed high stability of these agents in aquatic environments and that environmental processes or conventional wastewater treatments with low retention times would have little impact on prion infectivity. These results could have great repercussions in terms of risk assessment and safety for animals and human populations.},

Compelling evidence suggests that natural transmission of prion diseases is mediated by environmental contamination with infectious prions. We hypothesized that several natural and man-made materials, commonly found in the environments of wild and captive animals, can bind prions and may act as vectors for disease transmission. To test our hypothesis, we exposed surfaces composed of various common environmental materials (i.e. wood, rocks, plastic, glass, cement, stainless steel, aluminum, and brass) to hamster-adapted 263K scrapie prions and studied their attachment and retention of infectivity in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicated that these surfaces, with the sole exception of brass, efficiently bind, retain, and release prions. Prion replication was studied in vitro using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification technology, and infectivity of surface-bound prions was analyzed by intracerebrally challenging hamsters with contaminated implants. Our results revealed that virtually all prion-contaminated materials transmitted the disease at high rates. To investigate a more natural form of exposure to environmental contamination, we simply housed animals with large contaminated spheres made of the different materials under study. Strikingly, most of the hamsters developed classical clinical signs of prion disease and typical disease-associated brain changes. Our findings suggest that prion contamination of surfaces commonly present in the environment can be a source of disease transmission, thus expanding our understanding of the mechanisms for prion spreading in nature.},

Studies were done using a blind panel of 98 field-collected samples of whole blood from codon 96 glycine/glycine, captive white-tailed deer that were analyzed for prion infection post-mortem by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results showed a sensitivity of 100\% in animals with very poor body condition that were IHC-positive in both brain and lymph nodes, 96\% in asymptomatic deer IHC-positive in brain and lymph nodes and 53\% in animals at early stages of infection that were IHC-positive only in lymph nodes.

Examples include kuru, once the leading cause of death among the Fore people in Papua New Guinea and caused by mortuary feasting; bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and its subsequent transmission to humans in the form of variant Creutzfeldt\textendash{}Jakob disease (vCJD), and repeated examples of large-scale prion disease epidemics in animals caused by contaminated vaccines. The etiology of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a relatively new and burgeoning prion epidemic in deer, elk, and moose (members of the cervid family), is more enigmatic. The disease was first described in captive and later in wild mule deer and subsequently in free-ranging as well as captive Rocky Mountain elk, white-tailed deer, and most recently moose. It is therefore the only recognized prion disorder of both wild and captive animals. In addition to its expanding range of hosts, CWD continues to spread to new geographical areas, including recent cases in Norway. The unparalleled efficiency of the contagious transmission of the disease combined with high densities of deer in certain areas of North America complicates strategies for controlling CWD and raises concerns about its potential spread to new species. Because there is a high prevalence of CWD in deer and elk, which are commonly hunted and consumed by humans, the possibility of zoonotic transmission is particularly concerning. Here, we review the current status of naturally occurring CWD and describe advances in our understanding of its molecular pathogenesis, as shown by studies of CWD prions in novel in vivo and in vitro systems.},

Deer and elk with CWD have extensive aggregates of PrPSc not only in the central nervous system, but also in peripheral lymphoid tissues, skeletal muscle, and other organs, perhaps influencing prion shedding.

Genetic polymorphisms in the Prnp gene may affect CWD susceptibility, particularly at codon 225 (S/F) in deer and codon 132 (M/L) in elk.

Of the known animal prion diseases, only bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions have been shown to be transmissible from animals to humans under non-experimental conditions. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects cervids (e.g., deer and elk) in North America and isolated populations in Korea and Europe. Systematic review methodology was used to identify, select, critically appraise and analyse data from relevant research. Studies were evaluated for adherence to good conduct based on their study design following the Cochrane collaboration's approach to grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations (GRADE). Twenty-three studies were included after screening 800 citations from the literature search and evaluating 78 full papers. Studies examined the transmissibility of CWD prions to humans using epidemiological study design, in vitro and in vivo experiments. Five epidemiological studies, two studies on macaques and seven studies on humanized transgenic mice provided no evidence to support the possibility of transmission of CWD prions to humans. Ongoing surveillance in the United States and Canada has not documented CWD transmission to humans. However, two studies on squirrel monkeys provided evidence that transmission of CWD prions resulting in prion disease is possible in these monkeys under experimental conditions and seven in vitro experiments provided evidence that CWD prions can convert human prion protein to a misfolded state. Therefore, future discovery of CWD transmission to humans cannot be entirely ruled out on the basis of current studies, particularly in the light of possible decades-long incubation periods for CWD prions in humans. It would be prudent to continue CWD research and epidemiologic surveillance, exercise caution when handling potentially contaminated material and explore CWD management opportunities.},

  abstract = {This article summarises efforts at disease surveillance and risk management of chronic wasting disease (CWD). CWD is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of cervids and is considered to be one of the most contagious of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Evidence has demonstrated a strong species barrier to CWD for both human and farm animals other than cervids. CWD is now endemic in many US states and two Canadian provinces. Past management strategies of selective culling, herd reduction, and hunter surveillance have shown limited effectiveness. The initial strategy of disease eradication has been abandoned in favour of disease control. CWD continues to spread geographically in North American and risk management is complicated by the presence of the disease in both wild (free-ranging) and captive (farmed) cervid populations. The article concludes that further evaluation by risk managers is required for optimal, cost-effective strategies for aggressive disease control.},

  abstract = {Prion diseases are sub-acute neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and some domestic and free-ranging animals. Infectious prion agents are considered to comprise solely of abnormally folded isoforms of the cellular prion protein known as PrPSc. Pathology during prion disease is restricted to the central nervous system where it causes extensive neurodegeneration and ultimately leads to the death of the host. The first half of this review provides a thorough account of our understanding of the various ways in which PrPSc prions may spread between individuals within a population, both horizontally and vertically. Many natural prion diseases are acquired peripherally, such as by oral exposure, lesions to skin or mucous membranes, and possibly also via the nasal cavity. Following peripheral exposure, some prions accumulate to high levels within the secondary lymphoid organs as they make their journey from the site of infection to the brain, a process termed neuroinvasion. The replication of PrPSc prions within secondary lymphoid organs is important for their efficient spread to the brain. The second half of this review describes the key tissues, cells and molecules which are involved in the propagation of PrPSc prions from peripheral sites of exposure (such as the lumen of the intestine) to the brain. This section also considers how additional factors such as inflammation and aging might influence prion disease susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a naturally occurring, fatal neurodegenerative disease of cervids. The potential for swine to serve as hosts for the agent of CWD is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of swine to the CWD agent following experimental oral or intracranial inoculation. Crossbred piglets were assigned to three groups, intracranially inoculated (n = 20), orally inoculated (n = 19), and noninoculated (n = 9). At approximately the age at which commercial pigs reach market weight, half of the pigs in each group were culled ("market weight" groups). The remaining pigs ("aged" groups) were allowed to incubate for up to 73 months postinoculation (mpi). Tissues collected at necropsy were examined for disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc) by Western blotting (WB), antigen capture enzyme immunoassay (EIA), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and in vitro real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). Brain samples from selected pigs were also bioassayed in mice expressing porcine prion protein. Four intracranially inoculated aged pigs and one orally inoculated aged pig were positive by EIA, IHC, and/or WB. By RT-QuIC, PrPSc was detected in lymphoid and/or brain tissue from one or more pigs in each inoculated group. The bioassay was positive in four out of five pigs assayed. This study demonstrates that pigs can support low-level amplification of CWD prions, although the species barrier to CWD infection is relatively high. However, detection of infectivity in orally inoculated pigs with a mouse bioassay raises the possibility that naturally exposed pigs could act as a reservoir of CWD infectivity.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease of wild and captive cervids in North America. Prions are infectious agents composed of a misfolded version of a host-encoded protein, termed PrPSc. Infected cervids excrete and secrete prions, contributing to lateral transmission. Geographical distribution is expanding and case numbers in wild cervids are increasing. Recently, the first European cases of CWD have been reported in a wild reindeer and two moose from Norway. Therefore, methods to detect the infection early in the incubation time using easily available samples are desirable to facilitate effective disease management. We have adapted the real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay, a sensitive in vitro prion amplification method, for pre-clinical detection of prion seeding activity in elk feces. Testing fecal samples from orally inoculated elk taken at various time points post infection revealed early shedding and detectable prion seeding activity throughout the disease course. Early shedding was also found in two elk encoding a PrP genotype associated with reduced susceptibility for CWD. In summary, we suggest that detection of CWD prions in feces by RT-QuIC may become a useful tool to support CWD surveillance in wild and captive cervids. The finding of early shedding independent of the elk's prion protein genotype raises the question whether prolonged survival is beneficial, considering accumulation of environmental prions and its contribution to CWD transmission upon extended duration of shedding.},

New York State (NYS, USA) successfully managed an outbreak of CWD in 2005 in both captive and wild white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) with no reoccurrence of the disease as of 2015. To attain maximum compliance and efficacy of management actions for prevention of CWD entry, understanding the varied risk perceptions will allow for targeted, proactive communication efforts to address divergences between expert-derived risk assessments and stakeholder risk perceptions. We examined perceived risks associated with CWD introduction and exposure among agricultural and wildlife agency professionals within and outside of NYS, as well as stakeholder groups (e.g., hunters and captive cervid owners). We measured perceived risk using a risk assessment questionnaire online via Qualtrics survey software and evaluated similarities within, as well as differences in, perception among participant groups. New York State biologists employed by the Department of Environmental Conservation and independent non-NYS wildlife and agricultural professionals thought CWD risks associated with captive cervids were high; captive cervid owners thought risks for wild and captive cervids were low. Agriculture and wildlife professional groups agreed on general risk perceptions. We ranked 15 individual risk hazards into high and low\textendash{}medium categories based on all responses. Differences between groups were most evident in hypothetical disease pathways. Any pathway involving inter-state import of live cervids received high ranking for all groups except captive cervid owners. Comparatively low-risk perceptions by captive cervid operators may stem from misinformation, lack of understanding of testing programs, and indemnity payments for animal depopulation. Communication and education directed at areas of disagreement may facilitate effective disease prevention and management. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

Here we again use bioassays in deer to show that blood and saliva of pre-symptomatic deer contain infectious prions capable of infecting na\"ive deer and that na\"ive deer exposed only to environmental fomites from the suites of CWD-infected deer acquired CWD infection after a period of 15 months post initial exposure. These results help to further explain the basis for the facile transmission of CWD, highlight the complexities associated with CWD transmission among cervids in their natural environment, emphasize the potential utility of blood-based testing to detect pre-clinical CWD infection, and could augur similar transmission dynamics in other prion infections.},

Plants have the ability to take up large organic particles, including whole proteins, and microbes. This study used wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to investigate the uptake of infectious CWD prions into roots and their transport into aerial tissues. The roots of intact wheat plants were exposed to infectious prions (PrPTSE) for 24 h in three replicate studies with PrPTSE in protein extracts being detected by western blot, IDEXX and Bio-Rad diagnostic tests. Recombinant prion protein (PrPC) bound to roots, but was not detected in the stem or leaves. Protease-digested CWD prions (PrPTSE) in elk brain homogenate interacted with root tissue, but were not detected in the stem. This suggests wheat was unable to transport sufficient PrPTSE from the roots to the stem to be detectable by the methods employed. Undigested PrPTSE did not associate with roots. The present study suggests that if prions are transported from the roots to the stems it is at levels that are below those that are detectable by western blot, IDEXX or Bio-Rad diagnostic kits.},

Currently, tests for CWD in live animals involve relatively invasive procedures to collect lymphoid tissue biopsies and examine them for CWDassociated, protease-resistant cervid prion protein (PrPCWD) detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We adapted an ultrasensitive prion detection system, protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), to detect PrPCWD in Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) feces. Our PMCA reproducibly detected a 1.23107 dilution of PrPCWD (a 10\% infected brain homogenate diluted 1.23106-fold into 10\% fecal homogenates), equivalent to approximately 100 pg of PrPCWD/g of feces. We developed a semiquantitative scoring system based on the first PMCA round at which PrPCWD was detected and fit a nonlinear regression curve to our serial dilutions to correlate PMCA scores with known PrPCWD concentrations. We used this PMCA scoring system to detect PrPCWD and estimate its concentration in feces from free-ranging elk from Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. We compared our results to PrPCWD IHC of rectoanal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and obex from the same animals. The PMCA successfully detected PrPCWD in feces from elk that were positive by IHC, with estimated prion loads from 100 to 5,000 pg PrPCWD/g of feces. These data show for the first time PrPCWD in feces from naturally exposed free-ranging elk and demonstrate the potential of PMCA as a new, noninvasive CWD diagnostic tool to complement IHC.},

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) status and PrP genotypes were determined for a group of 133 wild white-tailed deer in a 780 acre enclosure in western Nebraska, USA. Approximately half of the deer tested showed evidence of PrPd in the brainstem or lymphoid tissues. Four PRNP alleles encoding amino acid substitutions were identified, with substitutions at residues 95 (Q$\rightarrow$H), 96 (G$\rightarrow$S) or 116 (A$\rightarrow$G), each with serine (S) at residue 138. In addition, a processed pseudogene with two alleles encoding five or six copies of the octapeptide repeat was identified in 26$\mkern1mu$\% of the deer. Both alleles encoded asparagine (N) at residue 138. The functional gene alleles sorted into five major diploid genotypes and four rare genotypes. Although all five major diploid genotypes were found in deer with CWD, unaffected deer were less likely to have the allele QGAS and more likely to have QSAS compared with CWD-affected deer. Late-stage disease (PrPd in brainstem) was noted in deer less than 1\hspace{0.25em}year of age, although no single genotype was associated with this rapid neuroinvasion. Early-stage disease (PrPd distribution limited to the lymphoid system) was observed in deer estimated to be more than 5\hspace{0.25em}years old, suggesting that they were infected as adults or that the incubation time might be extremely long in some individuals. The pseudogene was found in deer of all major PRNP genotypes and was not correlated with CWD status. The large number of susceptible genotypes and the possibility of adult-to-adult transmission suggest that much of the white-tailed deer population may be at risk for disease following exposure to CWD, despite the association of specific genotypes with CWD noted here.},

Transmission of infectious prions between animals and from the environment has resulted in spatial and temporal structure observable in the spatio-temporal patterns of reported cases. Case locations of 382 positive cases from 28,954 deer tested between 2002 and 2009 provided insight into the potential risk factors and landscape features associated with transmission using a combination of clustering, generalised linear modelling and descriptive evaluations of a risk map of predicted cases of CWD. A species distribution map of white-tailed deer developed using MaxEnt provided an estimate of deer locations. We found that deer probability increased in areas with larger forests and less urban and agricultural lands. Spatial clustering analysis revealed a core area of persistent CWD transmission in the northern part of the region. The regression model indicated that larger and more compact forests were associated with higher risk for CWD. High risk areas also had soils with less clay and more sand than other parts of the region. The transmission potential was higher where landscape features indicated the potential for higher deer concentrations. The inclusion of spatial lag variables improved the model. Of the 102 cases reported in the study area in the two years following the study period, 89 (87\%) of those were in the 32\% of the study area with the highest 50\% of predicted risk of cases.},

  abstract = {The landscape can influence host dispersal and density, which in turn, affect infectious disease transmission, spread, and persistence. Understanding how the landscape influences wildlife dispersal and pathogen epidemiology can enhance the efficacy of disease management in natural populations. We applied landscape genetics to examine relationships among landscape variables, dispersal of white-tailed deer hosts and transmission/spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal prion encephalopathy. Our focus was on quantifying movements and population structure of host deer in infected areas as a means of predicting the spread of this pathology and promoting its adaptive management. We analyzed microsatellite genotypes of CWD-infected and uninfected deer from two disease foci (Southern Wisconsin, Northern Illinois). We quantified gene flow and population structure using F \^sub ST\^, assignment tests, and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Gene flow estimates were then contrasted against a suite of landscape variables that potentially mediate deer dispersal. Forest fragmentation and grassland connectivity promoted deer movements while rivers, agricultural fields and large urbanized areas impeded movement. Landscape variables, deer dispersal, and disease transmission covaried significantly and positively in our analyses. Habitats with elevated host gene flow supported the concept of dispersal-mediated CWD transmission by reflecting a concomitant, rapid CWD expansion. Large, interrelated social groups isolated by movement barriers overlapped disease foci, suggesting that philopatry exacerbated CWD transmission. Our results promote adaptive management of CWD by predicting patterns of its spread and identifying habitats at risk for invasion. Further, our landscape genetics approach underscores the significance of topography and host behavior in wildlife disease transmission.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We used a landscape genetics approach to identify landscape features that influenced gene flow and the distribution of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Wisconsin white-tailed deer. CWD prevalence was negatively correlated with genetic differentiation of study area deer from deer in the area of disease origin (core-area). Genetic differentiation was greatest, and CWD prevalence lowest, in areas separated from the core-area by the Wisconsin River, indicating that this river reduced deer gene flow and probably disease spread. Features of the landscape that influence host dispersal and spatial patterns of disease can be identified based on host spatial genetic structure. Landscape genetics may be used to predict high-risk populations based on their genetic connection to infected populations and to target disease surveillance, control and preventative activities.},

  abstract = {1. The prevention and management of transmissible diseases hinges upon understanding host dispersal because it influences distribution of wildlife, affects the rate of disease transmission, and alters the spatial distribution of infection. The relationship between host dispersal and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids is of interest because potential interspecies transmission of fatal prion diseases creates serious risks for wildlife, domestic species, and humans. 2. We used molecular techniques to examine dispersal in a population of Illinois white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. Sampled individuals inhabited areas with confirmed cases of CWD, a transmissible prion disease of cervids, with additional sampling in uninfected locations. We genotyped 1410 deer harvested through CWD surveillance using 10 microsatellites and measured gene flow, determined population structure and quantified gender-specific differences in dispersal. Additionally we used spatial autocorrelation and parentage assignments to examine individual movements. 3. Female deer demonstrated philopatry as evidenced by higher levels of genetic structure, positive spatial autocorrelation and maternity assignments within one home range. 4. Male deer were less genetically structured and frequently exchanged genes across $>$100 km. 5. Synthesis and applications. Dispersal contributes to the spread of wildlife diseases. Therefore, knowledge of wildlife movement patterns can enhance the efficacy of disease control programmes. Our findings show that samples collected for disease surveillance are useful for measuring gene flow and inferring dispersal in white-tailed deer. High genetic admixture indicates males disperse regardless of landscape features. In contrast, distinct clustering of females demonstrates localized dispersal and philopatry. Taken together, results suggest that CWD surveillance and culling of males should be broadly expanded after an outbreak. Furthermore, surveillance of hunter-harvested deer can be used to identify locales in which CWD occurs, and this information should be used to focus culling efforts on females within genetically defined clusters (`matriarchal groups'). Removal of matriarchal groups at those locations will reduce horizontal transmission more than widely distributed population reductions.},

  abstract = {In many host-pathogen systems, pathogen transmission requires close contact between infectious and susceptible hosts. The contact rates among individuals depend upon how they move in the landscape because functional connectivity can affect interactions between individuals. Yet few studies have explored the interplay between contact rates, conspecific density, and functional connectivity. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we investigated how empirical movement rules translate into spatial patterns of contact rates among disease hosts in complex landscapes. We developed dynamic models of functional connectivity by characterizing movement behaviors of radio-collared raccoons, which are the main hosts of the raccoon rabies virus. On this basis, we simulated space-use dynamics of raccoons in virtual landscapes varying in conspecific density, forest availability, and landscape connectivity. We then characterized spatial patterns in the density of per capita contact rates of simulated raccoons. Radio-collared raccoons were more likely to choose large habitat patches that were reached by traveling along least-cost paths, and had relatively long residence times in anthropogenic areas, especially during daytime. These movement rules that were applied to simulated raccoons in virtual landscapes revealed three key patterns in contact rates. First, few simulated raccoons were responsible for most contacts between individuals, a pattern that emerged even though all simulated raccoons obeyed the same movement rules. Second, per capita contact rates increased linearly with individual density under most conditions, which indicates that raccoon rabies transmission should be density-dependent rather than frequency-dependent. Third, functional connectivity created a broad range of patterns in the density of per capita contact rates from decreasing to increasing values, depending upon the availability of land cover types. Overall, the contacts between hosts tended to occur at highest densities in forests, anthropogenic areas, and agricultural corridors. We show that complex patterns of contact rates can emerge from simple empirical movement rules and, therefore, can be key drivers of disease spread dynamics. The strong spatial heterogeneity observed in contact rates implies that the effectiveness of particular control interventions can strongly vary depending upon host density, landscape composition, and functional connectivity. This study provides key functional relationships for tailoring interventions to changes in local conditions.},

Because CWD is a relatively new issue for wildlife management agencies in the Northeast, we surveyed a representative (e.g., cervid biologist, wildlife veterinarian) from 14 states to gain a better understanding of state-specific surveillance measures.

Additionally, the 14 states surveyed have tested 121,730 harvested deer, or approximately 15,216/y, since CWD was first detected in 2005. The most common tissues used by agencies in the Northeast for testing were retropharyngeal lymph nodes, which have been determined to be the most reliable in detecting CWD in cervids. Understanding CWD surveillance efforts at a regional scale can help to provide guidance for the development of new surveillance plans or the improvement of existing ones. Furthermore, collaborations among state and regional agencies in the Northeast may attempt to identify deficiencies in surveillance by state or subregion.},

  doi = {10.1093/jmammal/gyu027},
  abstract = {In social species, individuals contact members of the same group much more often than those of other groups, particularly for contacts that could directly transmit disease agents. This disparity in contact rates violates the assumptions of simple disease models, hinders disease spread between groups, and could decouple disease transmission from population density. Social behavior of white-tailed deer has important implications for the long-term dynamics and impact of diseases such as bovine tuberculosis and chronic wasting disease (CWD), so expanding our understanding of their social system is important. White-tailed deer form matrilineal groups, which inhabit stable home ranges that overlap somewhat with others-a pattern intermediate between mass-action and strict territoriality. To quantify how group membership affects their contact rates and document the spectrum of social affiliation, we analyzed location data from global positioning system (GPS) collars on female and juvenile white-tailed deer in 2 study areas: near Carbondale in forest-dominated southern Illinois (2002-2006) and near Lake Shelbyville in agriculture-dominated central Illinois (2006-2009). For each deer dyad (i.e., 2 individual deer with sufficient overlapping GPS data), we measured space-use overlap, correlation of movements, direct contact rate (simultaneous GPS locations $<$ 10 m apart), and indirect contact rate (GPS locations $<$ 10 m apart when offset by 1 or 3 days). Direct contact rates were substantially higher for within-group dyads than between-group dyads, but group membership had little apparent effect on indirect contact rates. The group membership effect on direct contact rates was strongest in winter and weakest in summer, with no apparent difference between study areas. Social affiliations were not dichotomous, with some deer dyads showing loose but positive affiliation. Even for obvious within-group dyads, their strength of affiliation fluctuated between years, seasons, and even days. Our findings highlight the poor fit between deer behavior and simple models of disease transmission and, combined with previous infection data, suggest that direct contact is the primary driver of CWD transmission among free-living female and juvenile white-tailed deer.},

Life table data gathered from captive elk held in a CWD-contaminated facility was used to parameterize the model. Modeling the free-ranging elk herd without hunting or differences in survival by genotype resulted in a near extinction decrease in elk numbers over a 100-year period. However, incorporating differences in CWD-mortality by genotype into the model allowed the population to stabilize if hunting was modified to harvest only antlered elk. Our results indicate that, with flexible hunting management, elk populations could adapt to CWD through changes in the frequency of genotypes associated with the incubation time for CWD.},

Spatial models that quantify risk-driven differences in resource selection and hunter mortality of animals at fine spatial scales can assist disease management by identifying high-risk areas and individuals. We used resource selection functions (RSFs) and selection ratios (SRs) to quantify sex- and age-specific resource selection patterns of collared (n = 67) and hunter-killed (n = 796) nonmigratory elk (Cervus canadensis manitobensis) during the hunting season between 2002 and 2012, in southwestern Manitoba, Canada. Distance to protected area was the most important covariate influencing resource selection and hunter-kill sites of elk (AICw = 1.00). Collared adult males (which are most likely to be infected with bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) and chronic wasting disease) rarely selected for sites outside of parks during the hunting season in contrast to adult females and juvenile males. The RSFs showed selection by adult females and juvenile males to be negatively associated with landscape-level forest cover, high road density, and water cover, whereas hunter-kill sites of these cohorts were positively associated with landscape-level forest cover and increasing distance to streams and negatively associated with high road density. Local-level forest was positively associated with collared animal locations and hunter-kill sites; however, selection was stronger for collared juvenile males and hunter-killed adult females. In instances where disease infects a metapopulation and eradication is infeasible, a principle goal of management is to limit the spread of disease among infected animals. We map high-risk areas that are regularly used by potentially infectious hosts but currently underrepresented in the distribution of kill sites. We present a novel application of widely available data to target hunter distribution based on host resource selection and kill sites as a promising tool for applying selective hunting to the management of transmissible diseases in a game species.},

  abstract = {Quantifying animal contact rate is crucial both in fundamental and applied studies to understand the evolution of sociality and predict the spread of infectious diseases. Researchers typically use home-range overlap among individuals as a proxy of contact rate, assuming a positive correlation. However, very few studies have assessed how the correlation between home-range overlap and contact rate may vary with ecological context. We used proximity loggers to quantify intraspecific contact rate among raccoons (Procyon lotor) and explored the correlation between contact rate and home-range overlap in different seasons. We monitored 15 female raccoons that formed 121 dyads during summer 2010 and winter 2011. We compared contact rate with the 5 most common overlap indices: home-range overlap proportion, home-range overlap probability, utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI), volume of intersection index, and Bhattacharyya's affinity index. Our results generally supported the contention of a positive and significant correlation between home-range overlap and intraspecific contact rate in raccoons. The strength of the relationship differed among seasons and indices, being weaker during winter than summer for home-range overlap proportion and home-range overlap probability. When contact rates were high, their frequency had stronger correlations with the UDOI and volume of intersection index indices than with the other indices. Our results suggest that the UDOI performs better than other indices, as we obtained a good contact rate\textemdash{}home-range overlap correlation with this index with animals both aggregated and randomly distributed in space.},

  title = {Emerging Prion Disease Drives Host Selection in a Wildlife Population},
  volume = {22},
  issn = {1051-0761},
  abstract = {Infectious diseases are increasingly recognized as an important force driving population dynamics, conservation biology, and natural selection in wildlife populations. Infectious agents have been implicated in the decline of small or endangered populations and may act to constrain population size, distribution, growth rates, or migration patterns. Further, diseases may provide selective pressures that shape the genetic diversity of populations or species. Thus, understanding disease dynamics and selective pressures from pathogens is crucial to understanding population processes, managing wildlife diseases, and conserving biological diversity. There is ample evidence that variation in the prion protein gene (PRNP) impacts host susceptibility to prion diseases. Still, little is known about how genetic differences might influence natural selection within wildlife populations. Here we link genetic variation with differential susceptibility of white-tailed deer to chronic wasting disease (CWD), with implications for fitness and disease-driven genetic selection. We developed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay to efficiently genotype deer at the locus of interest (in the 96th codon of the PRNP gene). Then, using a Bayesian modeling approach, we found that the more susceptible genotype had over four times greater risk of CWD infection; and, once infected, deer with the resistant genotype survived 49\% longer (8.25 more months). We used these epidemiological parameters in a multi-stage population matrix model to evaluate relative fitness based on genotype-specific population growth rates. The differences in disease infection and mortality rates allowed genetically resistant deer to achieve higher population growth and obtain a long-term fitness advantage, which translated into a selection coefficient of over 1\% favoring the CWD-resistant genotype. This selective pressure suggests that the resistant allele could become dominant in the population within an evolutionarily short time frame. Our work provides a rare example of a quantifiable disease-driven selection process in a wildlife population, demonstrating the potential for infectious diseases to alter host populations. This will have direct bearing on the epidemiology, dynamics, and future trends in CWD transmission and spread. Understanding genotype-specific epidemiology will improve predictive models and inform management strategies for CWD-affected cervid populations.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms of pathogen transmission are often social behaviours. These occur at local scales and are affected by landscape-scale population structure. Host populations frequently exist in patchy and isolated environments that create a continuum of genetic and social familiarity. Such variability has an important multispatial effect on pathogen spread. We assessed elk dispersal (i.e. likelihood of interdeme pathogen transmission) through spatially explicit genetic analyses. At a landscape scale, the elk population was composed of one cluster within a southeast-to-northwest cline spanning three spatially discrete subpopulations of elk across two protected areas in Manitoba (Canada). Genetic data are consistent with spatial variability in apparent prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in elk. Given the existing population structure, between-subpopulation spread of disease because of elk dispersal is unlikely. Furthermore, to better understand the risk of spread and distribution of the TB, we used a combination of close-contact logging biotelemetry and genetic data, which highlights how social intercourse may affect pathogen transmission. Our results indicate that close-contact interaction rate and duration did not covary with genetic relatedness. Thus, direct elk-to-elk transmission of disease is unlikely to be constrained to related individuals. That social intercourse in elk is not limited to familial groups provides some evidence pathogen transmission may be density-dependent. We show that the combination of landscape-scale genetics, relatedness and local-scale social behaviours is a promising approach to understand and predict landscape-level pathogen transmission within our system and within all social ungulate systems affected by transmissible diseases.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the survival rates of 160 Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) over 6 years in the area of Wisconsin's highest prevalence of chronic wasting disease. Survival was very high for all age/sex classes and varied by season but not by year. When we omitted hunting mortality, yearlings and adults had similar annual survival, with survival of males (0.83-0.89) slightly lower than survival of females (0.91). However, including hunting mortality reduced survival of yearling and adult males to 0.72 and 0.41, and survival of yearling and adult females to 0.88 and 0.83, respectively. We also observed seasonal patterns, characterized by reduced survival across all sex and age classes during the rut season (10 October to 31 December), which includes the period of maximum hunting. Six mortalities (8.3\%) were associated with chronic wasting disease, including one deer that died from the disease. We find no evidence that CWD was substantially increasing mortality rates during the duration of our study from 2003 to 2007, though the disease is relatively new to this area. Our results can serve as a baseline by which to compare future mortality rates in this area to assess the virulence of CWD over time.},

  abstract = {The new synthesis about disgust is that it is a system that evolved to motivate infectious disease avoidance. There are vital practical and intellectual reasons why we need to understand disgust better. Practically, disgust can be harnessed to combat the behavioural causes of infectious and chronic disease such as diarrhoeal disease, pandemic flu and smoking. Disgust is also a source of much human suffering; it plays an underappreciated role in anxieties and phobias such as obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia and post-traumatic stress syndromes; it is a hidden cost of many occupations such as caring for the sick and dealing with wastes, and self-directed disgust afflicts the lives of many, such as the obese and fistula patients. Disgust is used and abused in society, being both a force for social cohesion and a cause of prejudice and stigmatization of out-groups. This paper argues that a better understanding of disgust, using the new synthesis, offers practical lessons that can enhance human flourishing. Disgust also provides a model system for the study of emotion, one of the most important issues facing the brain and behavioural sciences today.},

  abstract = {Although it is known that chronic wasting disease (CWD) can be transmitted by both direct animal-to-animal contact and contact with contaminated environments, the relative role of each mechanism in the spread of CWD in free-ranging populations has yet to be defined. We investigated patterns of interaction between mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in order to understand how factors such as season and landscape may influence patterns of disease spread in these populations. Using location data from male and female Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared mule deer in 5 study areas located in and around a CWDendemic zone in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, we quantified close proximity events, or events involving both spatial and temporal overlap of individuals. We defined close proximity events as occurrences in which 2 deer were located $<$25 m apart at the same point in time. We looked at seasonal variation in the probability of close proximity events, as well as landscape factors associated with these events when compared to areas of shared space use, or spatial overlap alone. Overall probability of an individual GPS-collared deer being located in close proximity to another GPS-collared deer was 0.092 (n = 107). The early gestation (16 Dec-31 Mar) and late gestation (1 Apr-15 May) seasons had the highest probability of close proximity events occurring, and same-sex pairs were more likely to be found in close proximity than between-sex pairs during all seasons aside from the rut (1 Nov-15 Dec). High probability of close proximity events during the gestation seasons agrees with the tendency of mule deer to aggregate into large groups during late winter and suggests that this may be an important time period for CWD transmission to occur. Close proximity events occurred more in cropland and wetland than expected based on availability, whereas close proximity events occurred less than expected in grassland. The opposite was true for spatial overlap between individuals, which occurred more than expected in areas of low elevation and rugged terrain and in grassland or shrub-wood habitats. These results suggest that cropland may be a higher risk habitat for direct and indirect CWD transmission between individuals and that, although coulees and other areas of rugged topography are less likely to be associated with close proximity events, those areas may be more likely to contain environmental contamination in CWD-affected areas due to common use by multiple deer.},

  abstract = {Movements of male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are of great concern with respect to spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) across landscapes because most yearlings males disperse and adult males have higher prevalence of CWD than do females and younger deer. We radiocollared and monitored 85 male white-tailed deer in the middle Missouri River Valley of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, USA from 2004 to 2008. Average size ($\pm$ SE) of fixed-kernel annual home ranges (95\%) and core areas (50\%) for resident deer were 449 ($\pm$ 32) ha and 99 ($\pm$ 7) ha, respectively. Resident deer exhibited a highdegree of fidelity to their home ranges. Mean overlap between consecutive annual home ranges and core areas was 81\% and 74\%, respectively. Average dispersal distance was 17.7 $\pm$ 4.5 km (range = 3\textendash{}121 km) for 22 radio-marked and 6 ear-tagged yearlings. Mean spring dispersal distance (25 km) was 150\% greater than fall (10 km). Dispersal direction from Desoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR) was bimodal on a northwest to southeast axis that followed the Missouri River corridor. Of 22 yearlings that dispersed 18 (82\%) established adult home ranges within the river valley. Dispersal movements of yearling males represent the greatest risk for rapid spread of diseases from infected source populations. Disease management efforts in riparian habitats should target male fawns and yearling males for removal in areas within or immediately adjacent to river corridors.},

  volume = {21},
  issn = {1051-0761},
  abstract = {Ecologists worldwide are challenged to contribute solutions to urgent and pressing environmental problems by forecasting how populations, communities, and ecosystems will respond to global change. Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data\textemdash{}model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding. Given the constraints inherent in the study of infectious disease and the urgent need for progress, fusion of data and expertise via this type of conceptual framework should prove an indispensable tool.},

We compared home-range size and overlap and resource selection among male and female mule deer and white-tailed deer to examine relative use of space in order to understand the potential for indirect spread of CWD better. We identified forested, riparian habitats as high selection of use and these habitats could likely contribute to the potential spreading of CWD between sympatric deer that concentrate in these areas. We found that migration, size of home range of female mule deer, and similarities in resource selection could contribute to sustaining or spreading CWD in Nebraska. The role of female mule deer in the spread of CWD coupled with selection for riparian corridors by both species should be investigated further, because these factors may be a primary determinant of disease spread in the historical range of mule deer.},

Consequently landscape, through its effects on dispersal, may influence many ecological processes, including disease transmission, invasion dynamics, and gene flow. To investigate influences of landscape features on dispersal patterns of a large mammal, we captured and radiomarked 363 juvenile male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), including 212 confirmed dispersers, in 2 topographically dissimilar study areas in Pennsylvania, USA. Dispersal azimuths were uniformly distributed in the western study area (WSA), where there was irregular, hilly topography. Mean dispersal azimuths paralleled ridge direction in the eastern study area, where long parallel ridges were aligned northeast\textendash{}southwest. Major roads in both areas and a large river in the WSA were semipermeable barriers to dispersal of juvenile males; dispersal paths were less likely to intersect these linear features. Dispersal movements were direct and brief, typically lasting $<$12 hours. For all dispersers, we found no evidence for preference or avoidance of establishing adult, postdispersal ranges in proximity to roads; however, deer that encountered roads near the terminus of their dispersal path were more likely to stop on the near side. Further, for deer that established postdispersal home ranges near major roads, these features influenced range placement such that locations were typically clustered on one side of the road. The influence of roads, rivers, and mountains on dispersal paths and postdispersal locations of white-tailed deer suggest that landscape-specific features should be considered in conservation and management of this and possibly other species of large mammals.},

  abstract = {Effective management of wildlife populations often requires motivating hunters to harvest sufficient numbers of animals of prescribed sex and age classes to meet management goals. For cervids, it is convenient to design harvest regulations relative to presence (male) or absence (young and female) of antlers because harvest of females has a larger effect on population growth. We used regression techniques to evaluate effects of 2 supplemental hunting programs based on additional days of hunting opportunity and an additional incentive used to complement additional days on harvest of antlered and antlerless deer in Wisconsin, USA. Earn-a-buck regulations, an incentive-based program that requires hunters to register an antlerless deer before being authorized to harvest an antlered deer, were associated with an average increase of 2.04 deer/km$^2$ in antlerless harvest and a 0.60 deer/km$^2$ decrease in harvest of antlered deer. Providing more opportunity for hunting of antlerless deer in the form of 4-and 8-day supplemental firearm seasons was associated with 1.10 deer/km 2 and 1.32 deer/km$^2$ increases, respectively, in antlerless harvest with trivial (0.02 deer/km$^2$ and 0.09 deer/km$^2$) decreases in harvests of antlered deer. Our analysis suggests that extra days of hunting opportunity coupled with the earn-a-buck incentive was 56-88\% more effective at increasing antlerless harvest relative to additional days of hunting without the incentive. Use of the earn-a-buck incentive resulted in decreased harvest of antlered deer and was disliked by many hunters. Quantifying these relationships is important for helping managers predict the costs and benefits of various hunting programs.},

Our goal was to model the movement of deer in Nebraska in an attempt to predict the potential for spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) into eastern Nebraska. We collared and radio-tracked $>$600 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Nebraska during 1990\textendash{}2006. We observed large displacements ($>$10km) for both species and sexes of deer, including migrations up to 100km and dispersals up to 50km. Average distance traveled between successive daily locations was 166m for male and 173 for female deer in eastern Nebraska, and 427m for male and 459 for female deer in western Nebraska. Average daily displacement from initial capture point was 10m for male and 14m for female deer in eastern Nebraska, and 27m for male and 28m for female deer in western Nebraska. We used these data on naturally occurring movements to create and test 6 individual-based models of movement for white-tailed deer and mule deer in Nebraska, including models that incorporated sampling from empirical distributions of movement lengths and turn angles (DIST), correlated random walks (CRW), home point fidelity (FOCUS), shifting home point (SHIFT), probabilistic movement acceptance (MOVE), and probabilistic movement with emigration (MOVEwEMI). We created models in sequence in an attempt to account for the shortcomings of the previous model(s). We used the Kolmogrov\textendash{}Smirnov goodness-of-fit test to verify improvement of simulated annual displacement distributions to empirical displacement distributions. The best-fit model (D=0.07 and 0.08 for eastern and western Nebraska, respectively) included a probabilistic movement chance with emigration (MOVEwEMI) and resulted in an optimal daily movement length of 350m (maximum daily movement length of 2800m for emigrators) for eastern Nebraska and 370m (maximum of 2960m) for western Nebraska. The proportion of deer that moved as emigrators was 0.10 and 0.13 for eastern and western Nebraska, respectively. We propose that the observed spread of CWD may be driven by large movements of a small proportion of deer that help to establish a low prevalence of the disease in areas east of the current endemic area. Our movement models will be used in a larger individual-based simulation of movement, survival, and transmission of CWD to help determine future surveillance and management actions.},

Although there are no reports of natural cross-species transmission of CWD to noncervids, infected deer carcasses pose a potential risk of CWD exposure for other animals. We placed 40 disease-free white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) carcasses and 10 gut piles in the CWD-affected area of Wisconsin (USA) from September to April in 2003 through 2005. We used photos from remotely operated cameras to characterize scavenger visitation and relative activity. To evaluate factors driving the rate of carcass removal (decomposition), we used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and a generalized linear mixed model. We recorded 14 species of scavenging mammals (6 visiting species) and 14 species of scavenging birds (8 visiting species). Prominent scavengers included American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana). We found no evidence that deer consumed conspecific remains, although they visited gut piles more often than carcasses relative to temporal availability in the environment. Domestic dogs, cats, and cows either scavenged or visited carcass sites, which could lead to human exposure to CWD. Deer carcasses persisted for 18 days to 101 days depending on the season and year, whereas gut piles lasted for 3 days. Habitat did not influence carcass decomposition, but mammalian and avian scavenger activity and higher temperatures were positively associated with faster removal. Infected deer carcasses or gut piles can serve as potential sources of CWD prions to a variety of scavengers. In areas where surveillance for CWD exposure is practical, management agencies should consider strategies for testing primary scavengers of deer carcass material.]},

Our finding of prions in antler velvet of CWD-affected elk suggests that this tissue may play a role in disease transmission among cervids. Humans who consume antler velvet as a nutritional supplement are at risk for exposure to prions. The fact that CWD prion incubation times in transgenic mice expressing elk prion protein are consistently more rapid raises the possibility that residue 226, the sole primary structural difference between deer and elk prion protein, may be a major determinant of CWD pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are important game mammals and potential reservoirs of diseases of domestic livestock; thus, diseases of deer are of great concern to wildlife managers. Contact, either direct or indirect, is necessary for disease transmission, but we know little about the ecological contexts that promote intrasexual contact among deer. Using pair-wise direct contacts estimated from Global Positioning System collar locations and joint utilization distributions (JUDs), we assessed habitats in which contacts occur to test whether direct contact rates among female white-tailed deer in different social groups differs among land-cover types. We also tested whether contact rates differed among seasons, lunar phases, and times of day. We obtained locations from 27 female deer for periods of 0.5-17 months during 2002-2006. We designated any simultaneous pair of locations for 2 deer $<$25 m apart as a direct contact. For each season, we used compositional analysis to compare land-cover types where 2 deer had contact to available land-cover weighted by their JUD. We used mixed-model logistic regression to test for effects of season, lunar phase, and time of day on contact rates. Contact rates during the gestation season were greater than expected from random use in forest and grassland cover, whereas contact rates during the fawning period were greater in agricultural fields than in other land-cover types. Contact rates were greatest during the rut and lowest in summer. Diel patterns of contact rates varied with season, and contact rates were elevated during full moon compared to other lunar periods. Both spatial and temporal analyses suggest that contact between female deer in different social groups occurs mainly during feeding, which highlights the potential impact of food distribution and habitat on contact rates among deer. By using methods to associate contacts and land-cover, we have created beneficial tools for more elaborate and detailed studies of disease transmission. Our methods can offer information necessary to develop spatially realistic models of disease transmission in deer.},

Titration of homogenates of kidneys and urinary bladders from the same animals gave concentrations 20,000-fold greater. Histologic and immunohistochemical examination of these same tissues showed no indications of inflammatory or other pathologic changes except for occasional deposits of disease-associated prion protein in kidneys. Although the source of TSE infectivity in urine remains unresolved, these results establish that TSE infectivity is excreted in urine and may thereby play a role in the horizontal transmission of natural TSEs. The results also indicate potential risk for TSE transmission from human urine--derived hormones and other medicines.},

  abstract = {In chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids and in scrapie in sheep, prions appear to be transmitted horizontally. Oral exposure to prion-tainted blood, urine, saliva, and feces has been suggested as the mode of transmission of CWD and scrapie among herbivores susceptible to these prion diseases. To explore the transmission of prions through feces, uninoculated Syrian hamsters (SHas) were cohabitated with or exposed to the bedding of SHas orally infected with Sc237 prions. Incubation times of $\sim$ 140 days and a rate of prion infection of 80\%-100\% among exposed animals suggested transmission by feces, probably via coprophagy. We measured the diseasecausing isoform of the prion protein \$($\backslash$Pr \{$\backslash$text\{P\}\}\^\{sc\} )\$ in feces by use of the conformation-dependent immunoassay, and we titrated the irradiated feces intracerebrally in transgenic mice that overexpressed SHa prion protein (SHaPrP). Fecal samples collected from infected SHas in the first 7 days after oral challenge harbored $\sim$60 ng/g \$($\backslash$Pr \{$\backslash$text\{P\}\}\^\{sc\} ) and prion titers of $\sim$ 1O$^{6}\cdot{}^{6}$ ID$_{4}_{0}$/g. Excretion of infectious prions continued at lower levels throughout the asymptomatic phase of the incubation period, most likely by the shedding of prions from infected Peyer patches. Our findings suggest that horizontal transmission of disease among herbivores may occur through the consumption of feces or foodstuff tainted with prions from feces of CWD-infected cervids and scrapie-infected sheep.},

Deer use was higher at 2 of the feeding sites than at natural feeding areas (P $\leq$ 0.02). Deer spent a higher proportion of time (P $<$ 0.01) feeding at pile (49\%) and spread (61\%) treatments than at natural feeding areas (36\%). We found higher deer use for rationed than ad libitum feeding quantities and feeding intensity was greatest at rationed piles and lowest at ad libitum spreads. We also observed closer pairwise distances ($\leq$0.3 m) among deer when corn was provided in a trough relative to spread (P = 0.03). Supplemental feeding poses risks for both direct and indirect disease transmission due to higher deer concentration and more intensive use relative to control areas. Concentrated feeding and contact among deer at feeding sites can also increase risk for disease transmission. Our results indicated that restrictions on feeding quantity would not mitigate the potential for disease transmission. None of the feeding strategies we evaluated substantially reduced the potential risk for disease transmission and banning supplemental feeding to reduce transmission is warranted.},

  abstract = {Disease surveillance in wildlife populations involves detecting the presence of a disease, characterizing its prevalence and spread, and subsequent monitoring. A probability sample of animals selected from the population and corresponding estimators of disease prevalence and detection provide estimates with quantifiable statistical properties, but this approach is rarely used. Although wildlife scientists often assume probability sampling and random disease distributions to calculate sample sizes, convenience samples (i.e., samples of readily available animals) are typically used, and disease distributions are rarely random. We demonstrate how landscape-based simulation can be used to explore properties of estimators from convenience samples in relation to probability samples. We used simulation methods to model what is known about the habitat preferences of the wildlife population, the disease distribution, and the potential biases of the convenience-sample approach. Using chronic wasting disease in free-ranging deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as a simple illustration, we show that using probability sample designs with appropriate estimators provides unbiased surveillance parameter estimates but that the selection bias and coverage errors associated with convenience samples can lead to biased and misleading results. We also suggest practical alternatives to convenience samples that mix probability and convenience sampling. For example, a sample of land areas can be selected using a probability design that oversamples areas with larger animal populations, followed by harvesting of individual animals within sampled areas using a convenience sampling method.},

  abstract = {Direct and indirect contact between wild and farmed cervids along perimeter fences may play a role in transmission of diseases like chronic wasting disease (CWD), but no studies have quantified such interactions. At 9 high-fenced commercial elk (Cervus elaphus) farms in Colorado, USA, during October 2003 to January 2005, we used animal-activated video to estimate rates of fence-line use by wild cervids, rates of direct contact between farmed and wild cervids, and probability of direct contact when wild cervids were present. We recorded 8-fold-more wild elk per unit time than mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) at fence lines. Depending on site, we recorded 0.66 to 46.90 wild elk per 1,000 hours of camera monitoring. We documented 77 interactions between wild and farmed elk involving naso-oral contact and no contact between wild mule deer and farmed elk. Rate of direct contact ranged from 0.00 to 1.92 direct contacts per 1,000 hours of camera monitoring among sites. Given recorded presence of wild elk, estimated probability of observing direct contact during a 2-minute video recording ranged from 0.00 to 0.11 among sites. Risk of direct contact was about 3.5 times greater for single woven-wire fence compared with offset electric fence attached to a single woven-wire fence. We observed no direct contact through double woven-wire fences. Because little is currently known about infection rates associated with infection mechanisms, we cannot infer a level of CWD infection risk from our results, but some form of double fencing should reduce potential for direct and indirect transmission of disease into or out of elk farms.},

Because lymphoid tissues are important in the pathogenesis of some transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as sheep scrapie, we investigated whether CWD-affected elk and deer differ in distribution or quantity of disease-associated prion protein (PrPres) in lymphoid tissues. Immunoblot quantification of PrPres from tonsil and retropharyngeal lymph nodes showed much higher levels of PrPres in deer than in elk. This difference correlated with the natural prevalence of CWD in these species and suggested that CWD-infected deer may be more likely than elk to transmit the disease to other cervids and have a greater potential to transmit CWD to noncervids.},

Twenty-five of 171 vehicle-killed mule deer tested positive for CWD (overall prevalence=0.146, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=0.097\textendash{}0.208); 173 of 2,317 deer sampled in the vicinity of these vehicle-killed deer tested positive (overall prevalence=0.075, 95\% CI=0.064-0.085). In nine often DAU\texttimes{}sex comparisons, relative risk of CWD infection tended to be higher among vehicle-killed deer (range of estimated relative risks=1.6\textendash{}15.9). Spongiform encephalopathy was detected in 12 of 20 (60\%; 95\% CI=39\textendash{}81\%) CWD-positive deer killed by vehicles and in 79 of 180 (44\%; 95\% CI=37\textendash{}52\%) CWD-positive deer detected via random sampling (relative risk=1.37; 95\% CI=0.92\textendash{}2.03), suggesting that infected deer killed by vehicles tended to be in later stages of disease than those killed by hunters. Our data offer evidence that CWD-infected mule deer may be relatively vulnerable to vehicle collisions. It follows that sampling of vehicle-killed mule deer may be exploited to increase efficiency of surveillance programs designed to detect new foci of CWD infection; moreover, evidence of increased susceptibility to vehicle collisions may aid in understanding vulnerability of CWD-infected individuals to other forms of death, particularly predation.},

This fatal prion disease has led to declines in populations which have high CWD prevalence and areas with both high and low infection rates have experienced economic losses in wildlife recreation and fears of potential spill-over into livestock or humans. Research from human and veterinary medicine has established that the prion protein gene (Prnp) encodes the protein responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Polymorphisms in the Prnp gene can lead to different prion forms that moderate individual susceptibility to and progression of TSE infection. Prnp genes have been sequenced in a number of cervid species including those currently infected by CWD (elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, moose) and those for which susceptibility is not yet determined (caribou, fallow deer, sika deer). Over thousands of sequences examined, the Prnp gene is remarkably conserved within the family Cervidae; only 16 amino acid polymorphisms have been reported within the 256 amino acid open reading frame in the third exon of the Prnp gene. Some of these polymorphisms have been associated with lower rates of CWD infection and slower progression of clinical CWD. Here we review the body of research on Prnp genetics of North American cervids. Specifically, we focus on known polymorphisms in the Prnp gene, observed genotypic differences in CWD infection rates and clinical progression, mechanisms for genetic TSE resistance related to both the cervid host and the prion agent and potential for natural selection for CWD-resistance. We also identify gaps in our knowledge that require future research.},

Imposing nonselective mortality representing a 15\% annual harvest or cull 51 yr after CWD introduction lowered both deer population size and steady state CWD. Selective (4\texttimes{}) mortality at the same 15\% predation rate caused a more modest reduction in deer population size accompanied by a relatively rapid decline in CWD prevalence and elimination of the disease from a closed population. The impacts of selective predation on epidemic dynamics were sensitive to assumptions on parameter estimates; however, within expected ranges, the results of selective predation were consistent and robust. We suggest that as CWD distribution and wolf range overlap in the future, wolf predation may suppress disease emergence or limit prevalence.},

The ratio of agriculture to forest showed strong positive correlation to home range size for most age and sex classes, while forest edge density was inversely related to home range size for adult females. Individual home range size proved largely independent of density and harvest intensity. It is likely that socio-spatial factors (i.e., fidelity) and the availability of food and cover influence home range size more strongly than hunting pressures or density reductions. This suggests localized reductions may create areas of low density without changing the behavior patterns of the population. Our findings suggest a more spatially-targeted effort to reduce density, by removal of social groups, in areas where chronic wasting disease is present may provide better efficacy in reducing potential for disease transmission.},

  doi = {10.2981/wlb.00012},
  abstract = {Wildlife managers often need tangible evidence of density dependence in populations to support decision making. Field experimentation to identify density dependent effects is often cost and time prohibitive. Thus, assimilation of existing knowledge into a balance of probabilities can serve as a surrogate for experimental research. A case study of such a process is found in the mule deer Odocoileus hemionus herds of Colorado. Wildlife managers and hunters expressed concern over a recent decline in western Colorado mule deer herds, yet the underlying cause of this decline is yet to be determined. In response to this management concern, we conducted a review of scientific evidence on Colorado's mule deer population dynamics. This review was done in the context of a conceptual model that portrays population growth as a function of population size, per capita growth rate and population carrying capacity. Similar declines that occurred during the 1960s and early 1990s resulted in similar reviews that identified research and management topics that would benefit mule deer. These topics included: harvest, predation, intraspecific competition, disease, interspecific competition, and habitat loss and degradation. Between the late 1990s and present time, many of these topics were addressed by research. The conventional working hypothesis in Colorado is that mule deer herds are limited by winter range habitat. We identify new gaps in knowledge and suggest potential, future research topics, as well as potential management strategies. We suggest a focus on integrated studies of multiple herbivores with density reduction experiments to address intra- and inter- specific competition. In addition, we suggest focused experiments that address the roles of mountain lion predation, black bear predation, and disease in mule deer population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Ungulate populations are important natural resources, associated with both costs and benefits. Conflicts have arisen between stakeholders who benefit from high ungulate numbers and those faced with the costs. Supplementary or diversionary feeding may potentially mitigate conflicts while maintaining harvest yields but can have conservation implications. We quantified the empirical evidence for whether the intended effects, and hence management goals, of feeding are met. We also examined whether any potential unintended consequences of feeding occur and under what conditions. We found clear evidence that supplementary feeding enhanced reproduction and population growth under certain conditions. By contrast, we found limited evidence of the effectiveness of diversionary feeding to protect crops, forestry, and natural habitats, with positive effects often undermined by increases in ungulate density. However, the use of diversionary feeding to reduce traffic collisions seems promising but requires further investigation. The unintended effects of feeding are typically complex, involving changes to demography, behavior, and vegetation with consequent cascading effects on other trophic levels, as well as exacerbated risks of disease transmission. Increased ungulate density is the primary driver behind these unintended effects, the consequences of which tend to increase with longevity of feeding and affect a range of stakeholders. We urge managers to take seriously the risks as well as the economic and ethical issues before deciding to feed ungulates. ? 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Transmission and impact of infectious diseases can be altered if host social structure is disrupted by disease outbreaks or lethal management. Specifically, if remnants of depopulated groups join or increase contact with neighboring groups, between?group transmission may increase even as population density decreases. We tested whether this phenomenon could apply to diseases of white?tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) by using a before?after?control?impact design. We monitored space use and contacts among adult female and juvenile deer in southern Illinois during 2011?2014; midway through each study season, we removed all members except 1 collared deer from centrally located groups and left control groups intact. After group removal, remnant adult females shortened duration of contacts with neighboring groups, whereas remnant juveniles responded with greater shifts in space use and appeared to join neighboring groups. Together, our study points to potential age?specific responses of deer to social disruption, with evidence that juveniles respond in ways that could shift disease transmission dynamics toward frequency dependence. These findings highlight the need for focused research into the importance of social disruption in disease dynamics, and lend support for complete group removal (if possible) when culling for disease management. ? 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

Hierarchical Bayesian modelling provides a framework to make statistical inference and probabilistic forecasts, using mechanistic ecological models. To illustrate, we show how hierarchical Bayesian models of ecological diffusion can be implemented for large data sets that are distributed densely across space and time. The hierarchical Bayesian approach is used to understand and forecast the growth and geographic spread in the prevalence of chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We compare statistical inference and forecasts from our hierarchical Bayesian model to phenomenological regression-based methods that are commonly used to analyse spatial occurrence data. The mechanistic statistical model based on ecological diffusion led to important ecological insights, obviated a commonly ignored type of collinearity, and was the most accurate method for forecasting.},

  abstract = {The disease-associated prion protein (PrPTSE), the probable etiological agent of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), is resistant to degradation and can persist in the environment. Lichens, mutualistic symbioses containing fungi, algae, bacteria and occasionally cyanobacteria, are ubiquitous in the environment and have evolved unique biological activities allowing their survival in challenging ecological niches. We investigated PrPTSE inactivation by lichens and found acetone extracts of three lichen species (Parmelia sulcata, Cladonia rangiferina and Lobaria pulmonaria) have the ability to degrade prion protein (PrP) from TSE-infected hamsters, mice and deer. Immunoblots measuring PrP levels and protein misfolding cyclic amplification indicated at least two logs of reductions in PrPTSE. Degradative activity was not found in closely related lichen species or in algae or a cyanobacterium that inhabit lichens. Degradation was blocked by Pefabloc SC, a serine protease inhibitor, but not inhibitors of other proteases or enzymes. Additionally, we found that PrP levels in PrPTSE-enriched preps or infected brain homogenates are also reduced following exposure to freshly-collected P. sulcata or an aqueous extract of the lichen. Our findings indicate that these lichen extracts efficiently degrade PrPTSE and suggest that some lichens could have potential to inactivate TSE infectivity on the landscape or be a source for agents to degrade prions. Further work to clone and characterize the protease, assess its effect on TSE infectivity and determine which organism or organisms present in lichens produce or influence the protease activity is warranted.},

Hunters were presented with hypothetical situations of increasing: (1) CWD prevalence (all eight states), and (2) human health risks (two states). Logistic regression equations estimated that at current prevalence levels in some states, 3\% (residents) to 5\% (nonresidents) of hunters would stop hunting deer/elk in their state. If 50\% of the deer or elk across the state were infected, approximately 42\% (residents) and 54\% (nonresidents) would stop hunting deer/elk in their state. In hypothetical situations where a hunter died from CWD at this prevalence level, the percentage was 68\%.

An important factor controlling interspecies TSE susceptibility is prion protein (PrP) homology between the source and recipient species/genotypes. Furthermore, the efficiency with which the protease-resistant PrP (PrP-res) of one species induces the in vitro conversion of the normal PrP (PrP-sen) of another species to the protease-resistant state correlates with the cross-species transmissibility of TSE agents. Here we show that the CWD-associated PrP-res (PrPCWD) of cervids readily induces the conversion of recombinant cervid PrP-sen molecules to the protease-resistant state in accordance with the known transmissibility of CWD between cervids. In contrast, PrPCWD-induced conversions of human and bovine PrP-sen were much less efficient, and conversion of ovine PrP-sen was intermediate.

This article explores an alternative approach for population reduction based on deer social organization. Female white-tailed deer are highly philopatric and female offspring remain near their dams for life. This suggests that a population expands slowly as a series of overlapping home ranges in a form analogous to the petals on a rose. Incorporating the rose petal concept into a model of population growth shows that removal of deer by family unit can potentially alleviate conflicts in localized areas for as many as 10\textendash{}15 yr.},

Lesions were similar in both species and were characterized by spongiform transformation of gray matter, intracytoplasmic vacuolation of neurons, neuronal degeneration and loss, astrocytic hypertrophy and hyperplasia, occurrence of amyloid plaques, and absence of significant inflammatory response. Distribution and severity of lesions were evaluated at 57 locations; there were only minor differences between deer and elk. Consistent, severe lesions occurred in olfactory tubercle and cortex, hypothalamus, and the parasympathetic vagal nucleus of deer, and sections examined from these regions would be sufficient to establish a diagnosis of chronic wasting disease. Lesions were milder in these locations in elk but were sufficiently apparent to be of diagnostic value. Other differences included increased severity of lesions in some thalamic nuclei in elk in contrast to deer, the occurrence of amyloid plaques demonstrable by hematoxylin and eosin and histochemical stains in deer in contrast to elk, and the presence of mild white matter lesions in elk but not in deer. Lesions of chronic wasting disease were qualitatively comparable to those of scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, transmissible mink encephalopathy, and the human spongiform encephalopathies. Topographic distribution and lesion severity of chronic wasting disease were most similar to those of scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

  abstract = {Though epidemiology dates back to the 1700s, most mathematical representations of epidemics still use transmission rates averaged at the population scale, especially for wildlife diseases. In simplifying the contact process, we ignore the heterogeneities in host movements that complicate the real world, and overlook their impact on spatiotemporal patterns of disease burden. Movement ecology offers a set of tools that help unpack the transmission process, letting researchers more accurately model how animals within a population interact and spread pathogens. Analytical techniques from this growing field can also help expose the reverse process: how infection impacts movement behaviours, and therefore other ecological processes like feeding, reproduction, and dispersal. Here, we synthesise the contributions of movement ecology in disease research, with a particular focus on studies that have successfully used movement-based methods to quantify individual heterogeneity in exposure and transmission risk. Throughout, we highlight the rapid growth of both disease and movement ecology and comment on promising but unexplored avenues for research at their overlap. Ultimately, we suggest, including movement empowers ecologists to pose new questions, expanding our understanding of host\textendash{}pathogen dynamics and improving our predictive capacity for wildlife and even human diseases.},

The percentage of adult ($\geq$3.5~years) males remaining on management units varied $<$4\% across three sites in southern Texas. The spatial extent of spread of disease by adult males would be less than movements associated with migration or dispersal. Based on size of home ranges and movements, $>$98\% of males would use management units of 1,000~km2 because their use of space would not result in use of adjoining management units. Migration of deer in northern latitudes resulted in 20\% of the population using management units of 1,000~km2, which potentially could expose large areas ($>$25,000~km2) to disease because a greater percentage of deer would use adjoining management units compared to deer in southern latitudes. Our results are useful in determining size and configuration of management units, which will improve formulation of management plans, analysis of data from harvests, and prediction and control of disease.},

  abstract = {Pathogen transmission is a key process in epidemiology and its mathematical form plays a pivotal role when modeling pathogen spread. Much work has been devoted to the transmission function applied to a homogeneous population structure. However, between-group transmission functions, required when different groups are identified to account for a distinct epidemiological risk, are much less documented. The aim of this study is to detail the mathematical form of five between-group transmission functions and to assess its influence on predictions in epidemiological modeling. Simulations with a two-group model were carried out so as to generate prediction differences among between-group transmission functions for a large range of situations, defined by the within-group transmission pattern, the basic reproduction number, the proportion of the whole transmission due to between-group transmission and the ratio of population sizes. Pathogen spread simulations highlighted differences in prevalence among four transmission functions (frequency-dependent, density-dependent and functions representing either a temporary mixing or a proportion of visitors exposed to infectious individuals). The differences could be seen either in long-term or in transient simulated dynamics. The fifth one, representing limited interactions at a gate, was shown to be equivalent to the density-dependent function in our parametrization when keeping constant group sizes. When considering population dynamics, particularly with increasing group sizes, this function and the density-dependent one were shown to behave opposite from each other and to differ from the other functions. This work highlights the need to carefully define the between-group transmission function when modeling pathogen spread in a heterogeneous structure. Our work brings insight into the biological grounds that could guide the choice of such a function.},

We analyzed tissue samples from free-ranging Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) and used hierarchical Bayesian analysis to estimate the specificity and sensitivity of IHC and sPMCA conditional on simultaneously estimated disease states.

Whether noncervid species can be infected by CWD and thereby serve as reservoirs for the infection is not known. To investigate this issue, we previously used serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) to demonstrate that CWD prions can amplify in brain homogenates from several species sympatric with cervids, including prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) and field mice (Peromyscus spp.). Here, we show that prairie voles are susceptible to mule deer CWD prions in vivo and that sPMCA amplification of CWD prions in vole brain enhances the infectivity of CWD for this species. Prairie voles inoculated with sPMCA products developed clinical signs of TSE disease approximately 300 days prior to, and more consistently than, those inoculated with CWD prions from deer brain. Moreover, the deposition patterns and biochemical properties of protease-resistant form of PrP (PrPRES) in the brains of affected voles differed from those in cervidized transgenic (CerPrP) mice infected with CWD. In addition, voles inoculated orally with sPMCA products developed clinical signs of TSE and were positive for PrPRES deposition, whereas those inoculated orally with deer-origin CWD prions did not. These results demonstrate that transspecies sPMCA of CWD prions can enhance the infectivity and adapt the host range of CWD prions and thereby may be useful to assess determinants of prion species barriers.},

In harvest-based sampling approaches, animal movements, changes in habitat utilization, changes in breeding behaviors during harvest periods, or differential susceptibility to harvest via behaviors like hiding or decreased sensitivity to stimuli may result in a non-random sample that biases prevalence estimates. We present a method that can be used to determine whether bias exists in prevalence estimates from harvest samples. Using data from harvested mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) sampled in northcentral Colorado (USA) during fall hunting seasons 1996\textendash{}98 and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) model selection, we detected within-yr trends indicating potential bias in harvest-based prevalence estimates for chronic wasting disease (CWD). The proportion of CWD-positive deer harvested slightly increased through time within a yr. We speculate that differential susceptibility to harvest or breeding season movements may explain the positive trend in proportion of CWD-positive deer harvested during fall hunting seasons. Detection of bias may provide information about temporal patterns of a disease, suggest biological hypotheses that could further understanding of a disease, or provide wildlife managers with information about when diseased animals are more or less likely to be harvested. Although AIC model selection can be useful for detecting bias in data, it has limited utility in determining underlying causes of bias. In cases where bias is detected in data using such model selection methods, then design-based methods (i.e., experimental manipulation) may be necessary to assign causality.},

Although CWD has been a serious concern among wildlife managers in several states in the United States and 2 Canadian provinces for over a decade, it is not known how CWD affects movement of hosts during the preclinical and clinical phases of disease. We hypothesized that normal movement patterns are altered by CWD. We evaluated migratory status, migration corridors, dispersal behavior, hourly activity patterns, home range areas, and resource selection for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) of known CWD status as a means of understanding how CWD infection influenced habitat use and disease spread. We captured deer, tested for CWD by tonsil biopsy, marked deer with radio-transmitters (2003\textendash{}2010) or global positioning system collars (2006\textendash{}2010), and recaptured individuals annually for CWD testing. The proportion of CWD-positive females that migrated was significantly less than CWD-positive males. All deer that were CWD-negative were more active than their CWD-positive cohabitants, which was most pronounced in fall for males when CWD-positive deer were significantly less active throughout the day. Home range areas were small ( = 1.99 km2) and were larger for CWD-negative females than CWD-positive females. Resource selection analyses indicated that all deer, regardless of CWD status, sex, or migratory status selected riparian habitats. Riparian habitats represent high CWD risk areas that should be targeted for potential disease management actions (e.g., surveillance, culling, environmental treatments). \textcopyright{} 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

A practical challenge of such surveillance is developing reliable, yet cost-effective, approaches that remain sustainable when monitoring needs are prolonged or continuous, or when resources to support these efforts are limited. In order to improve the efficiency of chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance in Colorado, United States, we developed a weighted surveillance system exploiting observed differences in CWD prevalence across demographic strata within infected mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations. We used field data to estimate sampling weights for individuals from eight demographic strata distinguished by differences in apparent health, sex, and age. In this system, individuals from a sample source with high prevalence and low inclusion probability (e.g., clinical CWD ``suspects'') received $\geq$10.3 times more weight than those from a source with low prevalence and high inclusion probability (e.g., apparently healthy, hunter-harvested individuals). We simulated use of this alternative surveillance system for a deer management unit in Colorado and evaluated the potential effects of using biased weights on the probability of failing to detect CWD and on relative surveillance costs. We found that this system should be transparent, cost-effective, and reasonably robust to the inadvertent use of biased weights. By implementing this, or a similar, weighted surveillance system, wildlife agencies should be able to maintain or improve current surveillance standards while, perhaps, collecting and examining fewer samples, thereby increasing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of ongoing CWD surveillance programs.},

Scrapie and CWD display considerable in vivo dissemination, with PrPSc and infectivity being found in a range of peripheral tissues. This in vivo dissemination appears to facilitate the recently reported excretion of prion through multiple routes such as from skin, faeces, urine, milk, nasal secretions, saliva and placenta. Furthermore, excreted scrapie and CWD agent is detected within environmental samples such as water and on the surfaces of inanimate objects. The cycle of `uptake of prion from the environment - widespread in vivo prion dissemination - prion excretion - prion persistence in the environment' is likely to explain the facile transmission and maintenance of these diseases within wild and farmed populations over many years.},

The Prnp gene sequence of free-ranging, Wisconsin white-tailed deer was determined and the Prnp genotypes of chronic wasting disease (CWD)-positive and CWD-negative deer were compared. Six amino acid changes were identified, two of which were located in pseudogenes. Two alleles, a Q$\rightarrow$K polymorphism at codon 226 and a single octapeptide repeat insertion into the pseudogene, have not been reported previously. The predominant alleles \textendash{} wild-type (Q95, G96 and Q226) and a G96S polymorphism \textendash{} comprised almost 98$\mkern1mu$\% of the Prnp alleles in the Wisconsin white-tailed deer population. Comparison of the allelic frequencies in the CWD-positive and CWD-negative deer suggested that G96S and a Q95H polymorphism were linked to a reduced susceptibility to CWD. The G96S allele did not, however, provide complete resistance, as a CWD-positive G96S/G96S deer was identified. The G96S allele was also linked to slower progression of the disease in CWD-positive deer based on the deposition of PrPCWD in the obex region of the medulla oblongata. Although the reduced susceptibility of deer with at least one copy of the Q95H or G96S allele is insufficient to serve as a genetic barrier, the presence of these alleles may modulate the impact of CWD on white-tailed deer populations.},

This type of hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible. They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems. We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters. While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before drawing ecological conclusions from their results.},

We determine the minimum set of mechanisms from all possible combinations of mechanisms with different weights for duration of seasonal segregation of sexes that are able to reproduce the observed ratio of CWD prevalence in adult males and females of $\sim$2 and greater. Multiple mechanisms are likely to produce the ratio of male:female prevalence levels and include: (1) environmentally mediated transmission associated with higher food intake by males, (2) female to male transmission during mating of this polygamous species, (3) increased male susceptibility to CWD and (4) increased intensity of direct contacts within male social groups. All of these mechanisms belong to the class of frequency-dependent transmission. Also important is seasonality in deer social structure with an increasing ratio of prevalence in males:females under all mechanisms as the duration of sexual segregation increases throughout a year.},

We use the model to explore the effects of 6 common harvest strategies on disease prevalence and to identify potential optimal harvest policies for reducing disease prevalence without population collapse. The model includes 4 deer categories (juveniles, adult females, younger adult males, older adult males) that may be harvested at different rates, a food-based carrying capacity, which influences juvenile survival but not adult reproduction or survival, and seasonal force of infection terms for each deer category under differing frequency-dependent transmission dynamics resulting from environmental and direct contact mechanisms. Numerical experiments show that the interval of transmission coefficients $\beta$ where the disease can be controlled is generally narrow and efficiency of a harvest policy to reduce disease prevalence depends crucially on the details of the disease transmission mechanism, in particular on the intensity of disease transmission to juveniles and the potential differences in the behavior of older and younger males that influence contact rates. Optimal harvest policy to minimize disease prevalence for each of the assumed transmission mechanisms is shown to depend on harvest intensity. Across mechanisms, a harvest that focuses on antlered deer, without distinguishing between age classes reduces disease prevalence most consistently, whereas distinguishing between young and older antlered deer produces higher uncertainty in the harvest effects on disease prevalence. Our results show that, despite uncertainties, a modelling approach can determine classes of harvest strategy that are most likely to be effective in combatting CWD.},

Cohorts of 5 cats each were inoculated intracerebrally (i.c.) or orally (p.o.) with CWD-infected deer brain. At 40 and 42 months postinoculation, two i.c.-inoculated cats developed signs consistent with prion disease, including a stilted gait, weight loss, anorexia, polydipsia, patterned motor behaviors, head and tail tremors, and ataxia, and the cats progressed to terminal disease within 5 months. Brains from these two cats were pooled and inoculated into cohorts of cats by the i.c., p.o., and intraperitoneal and subcutaneous (i.p./s.c.) routes. Upon subpassage, feline CWD was transmitted to all i.c.-inoculated cats with a decreased incubation period of 23 to 27 months. Feline-adapted CWD (FelCWD) was demonstrated in the brains of all of the affected cats by Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities in clinically ill cats, which included multifocal T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal hyperintensities, ventricular size increases, prominent sulci, and white matter tract cavitation. Currently, 3 of 4 i.p./s.c.- and 2 of 4 p.o. secondary passage-inoculated cats have developed abnormal behavior patterns consistent with the early stage of feline CWD. These results demonstrate that CWD can be transmitted and adapted to the domestic cat, thus raising the issue of potential cervid-to-feline transmission in nature.},

Some animal prion diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, can infect humans; however, human susceptibility to CWD is unknown. In ruminants, prion infectivity is found in central nervous system and lymphoid tissues, with smaller amounts in intestine and muscle. In mice, prion infectivity was recently detected in fat. Since ruminant fat is consumed by humans and fed to animals, we determined infectivity titers in fat from two CWD-infected deer. Deer fat devoid of muscle contained low levels of CWD infectivity and might be a risk factor for prion infection of other species.},

We hypothesized that it is possible to prevent peripheral CWD infection and CWD prion shedding by inducing auto-antibodies against the cellular prion protein (PrPC) by active vaccination. Our objective is to overcome self-tolerance against PrP by using a multimeric recombinant PrP (recPrP) as an immunogen. We expressed in E. coli, purified and refolded four immunogens: cervid and murine recPrP in monomeric and dimeric form. Testing immunogenicity in sera of the vaccinated transgenic mice expressing cervid PrP revealed that all four immunogens effectively overcame self-tolerance against the prion protein as shown by high antibody titers. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed effective binding of post-immune sera to surface-located PrPC in both murine and cervid PrP expressing cultured cells. Remarkably, the post-immune auto-antibodies effectively inhibited CWD-induced prion conversion in RT-QuIC assay when incubated with either PrP substrate or CWD seed. Furthermore, they mitigated prion propagation in CWD-infected cervid-PrP expressing RK13 cells. Together, multimeric recombinant cervid PrP effectively overcomes self-tolerance to PrP and induces auto-antibodies that interfere with CWD conversion in vitro.},

However, the disease transmission function is rarely known for free-living wildlife, leading to uncertainty regarding the impacts of diseases on host populations and effective control actions. We evaluated the influence of deer density, landscape features, and soil clay content on transmission of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in young ($\backslash$textless2-year-old) white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in south-central Wisconsin, USA. We evaluated how frequency-dependent, density-dependent, and intermediate transmission models predicted CWD incidence rates in harvested yearling deer. An intermediate transmission model, incorporating both disease prevalence and density of infected deer, performed better than simple density- and frequency-dependent models. Our results indicate a combination of social structure, non-linear relationships between infectious contact and deer density, and distribution of disease among groups are important factors driving CWD infection in young deer. The landscape covariates \% deciduous forest cover and forest edge density also were positively associated with infection rates, but soil clay content had no measurable influences on CWD transmission. Lack of strong density-dependent transmission rates indicates that controlling CWD by reducing deer density will be difficult. The consequences of non-linear disease transmission and aggregation of disease on cervid populations deserves further consideration.},

We quantified cause-specific mortality, survival rates, and habitat characteristics related to fawn survival in a forested landscape and an agricultural landscape in central Pennsylvania. We captured and radiocollared neonatal ($<$3 weeks) fawns in 2000-2001 and monitored fawns from capture until death, transmitter failure or collar release, or the end of the study. We estimated survivorship functions and assessed influence on fawn survival of road density, habitat edge density, habitat patch diversity, and proportion of herbaceous habitat. We captured 110 fawns in the agricultural landscape and 108 fawns in the forested landscape. At 9 weeks after capture, fawn survival was 72.4\% (95\% Cl=63.3-80.0\%) in the agricultural landscape and 57.2\% (95\% Cl=47.5-66.3\%) in the forested landscape. Thirty-four-week survival was 52.9\% (95\% Cl=42.7-62.8\%) in the agricultural landscape and 37.9\% (95\% Cl=27.7-49.3\%) in the forested landscape. We detected no relationship between fawn survival and road density, percent herbaceous cover, habitat edge density, or habitat patch diversity (all P$>$0.05). Predation accounted for 46.2\% (95\% Cl=37.6-56.7\%) of 106 mortalities through 34 weeks. We attributed 32.7\% (95\% Cl=21.9-48.6\%) and 36.7\% (95\% Cl=25.5-52.9\%) of 49 predation events to black bears (Ursus americanus) and coyotes (Canis latrans), respectively. Natural causes, excluding predation, accounted for 27.4\% (95\% Cl=20.1-37.3) of mortalities. Fawn survival in Pennsylvania was comparable to reported survival in forested and agricultural regions in northern portions of the white-tailed deer range. We have no evidence to suggest that the fawn survival rates we observed were preventing population growth. Because white-tailed deer are habitat generalists, home-range-scale habitat characteristics may be unrelated to fawn survival; therefore, future studies should consider landscape-related characteristics on fawn survival.},

Comparing the rate of spread of this pathogen to pathogens in terrestrial mammalian hosts, we see that elevation and factors relating to host abundance restrict disease spread, rather than finding any major effects of discrete barriers or anthropogenic movement. We examine the role of seasonality in the rate of spread, finding that the rate and direction of disease spread relates more to seasonality in host movement than to seasonality in disease prevalence. We conclude that asymptomatic carriers are major transmitters of Mycoplasma gallisepticum into novel locations, a finding which may also be true for many other diseases, such as West Nile Virus and avian influenza.},

These include opposition to the population goal, conflicts with traditions, conflicts with consumption norms, the uncertainty of the plan's efficacy, and perceived lack of credibility in the agency. We argue that these six clusters of attitudinal beliefs made it unlikely that hunter support could have been cultivated regardless of the scope or pace of the CWD eradication effort.

Timing of mid-winter movements varied among years and appeared related to weather severity. In spring, deer concentrated around meadows until migrating to summer range. Timing of spring migration varied annually and was related to winter severity. During summer, deer were generally sedentary. However, of 8 animals that made extended movements, 6 were yearlings. We found little evidence of dispersal as all adult deer demonstrated strong fidelity to seasonal movement patterns, returning to essentially the identical locales occupied on summer and winter ranges in previous years. We suggest that the seasonal movements of migratory mule deer in the intermountain west are driven and controlled by seasonal changes in energetic needs of the animals and by the quantity and quality of forage available within the year-round range of the animals.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of abundance forms a central challenge in population ecology and wildlife management. Many statistical techniques have been developed to estimate population sizes because populations change over time and space and to correct for the bias resulting from animals that are present in a study area but not observed. The mobility of individuals makes it difficult to design sampling procedures that account for movement into and out of areas with fixed jurisdictional boundaries. Aerial surveys are the gold standard used to obtain data of large mobile species in geographic regions with harsh terrain, but these surveys can be prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Estimating abundance with ground-based census methods have practical advantages, but it can be difficult to simultaneously account for temporary emigration and observer error to avoid biased results. Contemporary research in population ecology increasingly relies on telemetry observations of the states and locations of individuals to gain insight on vital rates, animal movements, and population abundance. Analytical models that use observations of movements to improve estimates of abundance have not been developed. Here we build upon existing multi-state mark\textendash{}recapture methods using a hierarchical N-mixture model with multiple sources of data, including telemetry data on locations of individuals, to improve estimates of population sizes. We used a state-space approach to model animal movements to approximate the number of marked animals present within the study area at any observation period, thereby accounting for a frequently changing number of marked individuals. We illustrate the approach using data on a population of elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) in Northern Colorado, USA. We demonstrate substantial improvement compared to existing abundance estimation methods and corroborate our results from the ground based surveys with estimates from aerial surveys during the same seasons. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian N-mixture model using multiple sources of data on abundance, movement and survival to estimate the population size of a mobile species that uses remote conservation areas. The model improves accuracy of inference relative to previous methods for estimating abundance of open populations.},

  abstract = {A new procedure for constructing confidence interval estimates of population size in mark-sight experiments is presented. The method of selecting animals for marking must be equivalent to a simple random sample without replacement. Marked animals are required to be individually identifiable. The number of times animals are sighted must be independent of their mark status. The sighting process does not need to be composed of independent sighting trials or even decomposable into separate trials. Sighting probabilities can vary among individuals and can depend on such factors as group size and vegetational cover. Other methods of constructing confidence intervals in mark-sight experiments given these latter conditions have failed to achieve their stated nominal confidence level. Our confidence interval procedures are shown by simulation to have actual confidence levels close to nominal under conditions encountered in an application to a Colorado moose (Alces alces shirasi) population. For this population with 29 radio-collared moose and 5 helicopter sighting flights, the 90\% confidence interval for the moose population size on the \$1,400$\backslash$text\{-km\}\^\{2\}\$ area was 382-505.},

This article examines the conditions for establishment and long-term population dynamic behavior of pathogens that infect multiple species of hosts.

Second, under what conditions is it possible to control an infectious agent by focusing control against only one host species? Third, what role does host species diversity play in maintaining pathogen persistence? The answers to these questions supply some important general insights into the role that biodiversity plays in buffering humans and other species against new and emerging pathogens.},

  abstract = {Background Wildlife populations are difficult to monitor directly because of costs and logistical challenges associated with collecting informative abundance data from live animals. By contrast, data on harvested individuals (e.g., age and sex) are often readily available. Increasingly, integrated population models are used for natural resource management because they synthesize various relevant data into a single analysis.  Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the performance of integrated population models applied to black bears (Ursus americanus) in Minnesota, USA. Models were constructed using sex-specific age-at-harvest matrices (1980\textendash{}2008), data on hunting effort and natural food supplies (which affects hunting success), and statewide mark\textendash{}recapture estimates of abundance (1991, 1997, 2002). We compared this approach to Downing reconstruction, a commonly used population monitoring method that utilizes only age-at-harvest data. We first conducted a large-scale simulation study, in which our integrated models provided more accurate estimates of population trends than did Downing reconstruction. Estimates of trends were robust to various forms of model misspecification, including incorrectly specified cub and yearling survival parameters, age-related reporting biases in harvest data, and unmodeled temporal variability in survival and harvest rates. When applied to actual data on Minnesota black bears, the model predicted that harvest rates were negatively correlated with food availability and positively correlated with hunting effort, consistent with independent telemetry data. With no direct data on fertility, the model also correctly predicted 2-point cycles in cub production. Model-derived estimates of abundance for the most recent years provided a reasonable match to an empirical population estimate obtained after modeling efforts were completed.  Conclusions/Significance Integrated population modeling provided a reasonable framework for synthesizing age-at-harvest data, periodic large-scale abundance estimates, and measured covariates thought to affect harvest rates of black bears in Minnesota. Collection and analysis of these data appear to form the basis of a robust and viable population monitoring program.},

  abstract = {Behavior and habitat of wildlife animals change seasonally according to environmental conditions. Mathematical models need to represent this seasonality to be able to make realistic predictions about the future of a population and the effectiveness of human interventions. Managing and modeling disease in wild animal populations requires particular care in that disease transmission dynamics is a critical consideration in the etiology of both human and animal diseases, with different transmission paradigms requiring different disease risk management strategies. Since transmission of infectious diseases among wildlife depends strongly on social behavior, mechanisms of disease transmission could also change seasonally. A specific consideration in this regard confronted by modellers is whether the contact rate between individuals is density-dependent or frequency-dependent. We argue that seasonal behavior changes could lead to a seasonal shift between density and frequency dependence. This hypothesis is explored in the case of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal disease that affects deer, elk and moose in many areas of North America. Specifically, we introduce a strategic CWD risk model based on direct disease transmission that accounts for the seasonal change in the transmission dynamics and habitats occupied, guided by information derived from cervid ecology. The model is composed of summer and winter susceptible-infected (SI) equations, with frequency-dependent and density-dependent transmission dynamics, respectively. The model includes impulsive birth events with density-dependent birth rate. We determine the basic reproduction number as a weighted average of two seasonal reproduction numbers. We parameterize the model from data derived from the scientific literature on CWD and deer ecology, and conduct global and local sensitivity analyses of the basic reproduction number. We explore the effectiveness of different culling strategies for the management of CWD: although summer culling seems to be an effective disease eradication strategy, the total culling rate is limited by the requirement to preserve the herd.},

  abstract = {The epidemiologic transition describes changing patterns of population age distributions, mortality, fertility, life expectancy, and causes of death. A number of critiques of the theory have revealed limitations, including an insufficient account of the role of poverty in determining disease risk and mortality, a failure to distinguish adequately the risk of dying from a given cause or set of causes from the relative contributions of various causes of death to overall mortality, and oversimplification of the transition patterns, which do not fit neatly into either historical periods or geographic locations. Recent developments in epidemiologic methods reveal other limitations. A life course perspective prompts examination of changes in causal pathways across the life span when considering shifts in the age distribution of a population as described by the epidemiologic transition theory. The ecological model assumes multiple levels of determinants acting in complex and interrelated ways, with higher level determinants exhibiting emergent properties. Development, testing, and implementation of innovative approaches to reduce the risks associated with the sedentary lifestyle and hyper nutrition in developed countries should not overshadow the continuing threat from infectious diseases, especially resistant strains or newly encountered agents. Interventions must fit populations and the threats to health they experience, while anticipating changes that will emerge with success in some areas. This will require new ways of thinking that go beyond the epidemiologic transition theory.},

  abstract = {The propensity for transspecies prion transmission is related to the structural characteristics of the enciphering and new host PrP, although the exact mechanism remains incompletely understood. The effects of variability in prion protein on cross-species prion transmission have been studied with animal bioassays, but the influence of prion protein structure versus that of host cofactors (e.g., cellular constituents, trafficking, and innate immune interactions) remains difficult to dissect. To isolate the effects of protein-protein interactions on transspecies conversion, we used recombinant PrPC and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and compared chronic wasting disease (CWD) and classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (cBSE) prions. To assess the impact of transmission to a new species, we studied feline CWD (fCWD) and feline BSE (i.e., feline spongiform encephalopathy [FSE]). We cross-seeded fCWD and FSE into each species' full-length, recombinant PrPC and measured the time required for conversion to the amyloid (PrPRes) form, which we describe here as the rate of amyloid conversion. These studies revealed the following: (i) CWD and BSE seeded their homologous species' PrP best; (ii) fCWD was a more efficient seed for feline rPrP than for white-tailed deer rPrP; (iii) conversely, FSE more efficiently converted bovine than feline rPrP; (iv) and CWD, fCWD, BSE, and FSE all converted human rPrP, although not as efficiently as homologous sCJD prions. These results suggest that (i) at the level of protein-protein interactions, CWD adapts to a new species more readily than does BSE and (ii) the barrier preventing transmission of CWD to humans may be less robust than estimated.
IMPORTANCE We demonstrate that bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions maintain their transspecies conversion characteristics upon passage to cats but that chronic wasting disease prions adapt to the cat and are distinguishable from the original prion. Additionally, we showed that chronic wasting disease prions are effective at seeding the conversion of normal human prion protein to an amyloid conformation, perhaps the first step in crossing the species barrier.},

Templated conversion has been modelled in several in vitro assays, including serial protein misfolding amplification, amyloid seeding and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). As RT-QuIC measures formation of amyloid fibrils in real-time, it can be used to estimate the rate of seeded conversion. Here, we used samples from deer infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD) in RT-QuIC to show that serial dilution of prion seed was linearly related to the rate of amyloid formation over a range of 10-3 to 10-8 $\mathrm{\mu}$g. We then used an amyloid formation rate standard curve derived from a bioassayed reference sample (CWD+ brain homogenate) to estimate the prion seed concentration and infectivity in tissues, body fluids and excreta. Using these methods, we estimated that urine and saliva from CWD-infected deer both contained 1\textendash{}5 LD50 per 10 ml.

Because meat consumption is the most likely means of exposure, it is important to determine whether skeletal muscle of diseased cervids contains prion infectivity. Here bioassays in transgenic mice expressing cervid prion protein revealed the presence of infectious prions in skeletal muscles of CWD-infected deer, demonstrating that humans consuming or handling meat from CWD-infected deer are at risk to prion exposure.

  doi = {10.1099/0022-1317-83-10-2617},
  abstract = {Up to 15\% of free-ranging mule deer in northeastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming, USA, are afflicted with a prion disease, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), known as chronic wasting disease (CWD). CWD is similar to a subset of TSEs including scrapie and variant Creutzfeldt\textendash{}Jakob disease in which the abnormal prion protein isoform, PrPCWD, accumulates in lymphoid tissue. Experimental scrapie studies have indicated that this early lymphoid phase is an important constituent of prion replication interposed between mucosal entry and central nervous system accumulation. To identify the lymphoid target cells associated with PrPCWD, we used triple-label immunofluorescence and high-resolution confocal microscopy on tonsils from naturally infected deer in advanced disease. We detected PrPCWD primarily extracellularly in association with follicular dendritic and B cell membranes as determined by frequent co-localization with antibodies against membrane bound immunoglobulin and CD21. There was minimal co-localization with cytoplasmic labels for follicular dendritic cells (FDC). This finding could indicate FDC capture of PrPCWD, potentially in association with immunoglobulin or complement, or PrPC conversion on FDC. In addition, scattered tingible body macrophages in the germinal centre contained coarse intracytoplasmic aggregates of PrPCWD, reflecting either phagocytosis of PrPCWD on FDC processes, apoptotic FDC or B cells, or actual PrPCWD replication within tingible body macrophages. To compare lymphoid cell targets in early and advanced disease, we also examined: (i) PrPCWD distribution in lymphoid cells of fawns within 3 months of oral CWD exposure and (ii) tonsil biopsies from preclinical deer with naturally acquired CWD. These studies revealed that the early lymphoid cellular distribution of PrPCWD was similar to that in advanced disease, i.e. in a pattern suggesting FDC association. We conclude that in deer, PrPCWD accumulates primarily extracellularly and associated with FDCs and possibly B cells \textendash{} a finding which raises questions as to the cells responsible for pathological prion production.},

We recap how the existence of the invasion threshold is linked to the nature of the transmission term in theoretical studies. We examine some of the main thresholds that can affect host population dynamics including the Allee effect and then relate these to parasite thresholds, as a way to assess the dynamic consequences of the interplay between host and parasite thresholds on the final outcome of the system.

The disease has been reported across North America and recently discovered in northern Europe. Transmission of CWD in wild cervid populations can occur through environmental routes, but limited ability to detect prions in environmental samples has prevented the identification of potential transmission ``hot spots''. We establish widespread CWD prion contamination of mineral licks used by free-ranging cervids in an enzootic area in Wisconsin, USA. We show mineral licks can serve as reservoirs of CWD prions and thus facilitate disease transmission. Furthermore, mineral licks attract livestock and other wildlife that also obtain mineral nutrients via soil and water consumption. Exposure to CWD prions at mineral licks provides potential for cross-species transmission to wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Managing deer use of mineral licks warrants further consideration to help control outbreaks of CWD.},

A new technology uses proximity data loggers to record time and duration of contacts. We conducted an experiment at Sandhill Wildlife Management Area, located near Babcock, Wisconsin (USA) to compare probabilities of detecting intraspecific contacts among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) maternal pairs (dams/fawns) based on detections from proximity loggers deployed on collars versus those obtained from direct observation. We defined 5 discrete probabilities of detection of a contact in terms of P (probability of detection by a single proximity logger) and V (probability of detection by visual observer) and estimated P and V by minimizing the Kullback\textendash{}Liebler distance between distributions of theoretical probabilities and observed distributions in experimental data. We used parametric jackknifing to estimate means and variances for P and V. Mean estimates of P and V were 0.64 (95\% CI\,=\,0.62\textendash{}0.67) and 0.34 (0.32\textendash{}0.35), respectively. Estimates of P and V enabled the calculation of the probability that an encounter was undetected by both proximity loggers and the visual observer, which was 0.09 (95\% CI\,=\,0.073\textendash{}0.094). Estimates of P and V provide estimates of nondetection bias for future studies that use proximity loggers to estimate frequencies of encounters and help quantify the usefulness of this technology relative to visual observation. Management concerns such as chronic wasting disease and bovine tuberculosis could be better understood and addressed by using proximity loggers because they are better able to quantify close contact than conventional methods such as radiotelemetry or Global Positioning System telemetry. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Disease is often expected to limit host populations, but diseases do not always dramatically reduce host numbers and often have no effect. The impact of a fungal pathogen (Entomophaga grylli pathotype 1) on grasshopper (Camnula pellucida) populations was studied in a field experiment. We tested whether the effects of disease on grasshopper survival were additive, with disease mortality summing with other mortality sources to determine the total population mortality rate; or whether they were compensatory, where disease mortality simply replaces mortality from other sources so that the total population mortality rate remains unchanged. We examined grasshopper survival in relation to differences in disease exposure, host density levels, and host developmental stage. The effects of disease varied with grasshopper developmental stage and density. Disease mortality increased by 60\% at high grasshopper density compared to low-density treatments, and decreased when grasshoppers fully matured. Despite increased rates of disease mortality at high densities, the total mortality rate was not notably higher in diseased grasshoppers (87\%) compared to disease-free counterparts at high densities (83\%), indicating that a large percentage of disease mortality simply replaced mortality from food limitation. Additive responses were supported in early and late instars, with disease exposure resulting in decreased grasshopper survival. In contrast, the effect of disease on adults was inconclusive. Yet, the disease did not affect adult survival, suggesting that adult disease mortality is compensatory. Therefore, disease reduction of grasshopper populations (additive mortality) is more likely to occur during earlier developmental stages, when hosts are most vulnerable to disease, and at low host densities when food is abundant. Combined, our results emphasize the importance of host dynamics and food availability in how this host\textendash{}pathogen system responds to disease. Accordingly, compensatory vs. additive mortality may need to be considered when examining how disease ultimately affects host population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America, and both the annual incidence and geographic range are increasing. The emergence of Lyme disease has been attributed to a century-long recovery of deer, an important reproductive host for adult ticks. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that Lyme disease risk may now be more dynamically linked to fluctuations in the abundance of small-mammal hosts that are thought to infect the majority of ticks. The continuing and rapid increase in Lyme disease over the past two decades, long after the recolonization of deer, suggests that other factors, including changes in the ecology of small-mammal hosts may be responsible for the continuing emergence of Lyme disease. We present a theoretical model that illustrates how reductions in small-mammal predators can sharply increase Lyme disease risk. We then show that increases in Lyme disease in the northeastern and midwestern United States over the past three decades are frequently uncorrelated with deer abundance and instead coincide with a range-wide decline of a key small-mammal predator, the red fox, likely due to expansion of coyote populations. Further, across four states we find poor spatial correlation between deer abundance and Lyme disease incidence, but coyote abundance and fox rarity effectively predict the spatial distribution of Lyme disease in New York. These results suggest that changes in predator communities may have cascading impacts that facilitate the emergence of zoonotic diseases, the vast majority of which rely on hosts that occupy low trophic levels.},

The extent to which wolf predation contributed to this decline is not obvious because the influence of other factors (human harvest and lower than average annual rainfall) on elk dynamics has not been quantified. To assess the contribution of wolf predation to this elk decline, we built and assessed models based on elk-related data prior to wolf reintroduction (1961 to 1995). We then used the best of these models to predict how elk dynamics might have been realized after wolf reintroduction (1995 to 2004) had wolves never been reintroduced. The best performing model predicted 64\% of the variance in growth rate and included elk abundance, harvest rate, annual snowfall, and annual precipitation as predictor variables. The best performing models also suggest that harvest may be super-additive. That is, for every one percent increase in harvest rate, elk population growth rate declines by more than one percent. Harvest rate also accounted for $\sim$47\% of the observed variation in elk growth rate. According to the best-performing model, which accounts for harvest rate and climate, the elk population would have been expected to decline by 7.9\% per year, on average, between 1995 and 2004. Within the limits of uncertainty, which are not trivial, climate and harvest rate are justified explanations for most of the observed elk decline. To the extent that this is true, we suggest that between 1995 and 2004 wolf predation was primarily compensatory.},

  abstract = {Abstract The size of disease epidemics remains difficult to predict, especially when parasites interact with multiple species. Traits of focal hosts like susceptibility could directly predict epidemic size, while other traits including competitive ability might shape it indirectly in communities with a ?dilution effect.? In a dilution effect, diluter taxa can reduce disease by regulating (lowering) the density of focal hosts (i.e. through competition) or by reducing encounters between focal hosts and parasites. However, these dilution mechanisms are rarely grounded in focal host traits, and the relative importance of host regulation vs. encounter reduction remains understudied. Here, we map focal host traits to disease?via these dilution mechanisms?in communities with diluters. We measured two traits (competitive ability and susceptibility) for eight genotypes of a focal host (Daphnia), tracked the densities of each genotype in experimental mesocosms (+/? Ceriodaphnia competitor/diluters) and monitored their infections with a virulent fungal parasite (Metschnikowia) over 6?8 host generations. We disentangled the impacts of both traits on the density of infected hosts and partitioned dilution mechanisms using path models. Higher susceptibility directly fuelled larger epidemics. Simultaneously, weaker competitive ability indirectly suppressed epidemics by enabling higher densities of diluters. These higher densities of diluters reduced the density of infected hosts indirectly via host regulation. In contrast, encounter reduction was much weaker. Our experiment strengthens the dilution effect paradigm with a predictable, traits?oriented framework. Similar traits?susceptibility, competitive ability and their covariance?could help predict epidemic severity in a variety of other systems. Partitioning the direct and indirect effects of diluters could also delineate how they impact disease. Such trait?based insights could help broadly predict the size of epidemics in diverse communities. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

  abstract = {1. Predators could reduce disease prevalence in prey populations by culling infected hosts and reducing host density. However, recently observed positive correlations between predator density and disease burdens in prey/hosts suggest that predators do not always ' keep the herds healthy'. Several possible mechanisms could explain this 'unhealthy herds' effect, including a predator-induced change in prey/host traits which enhances susceptibility or alters other epidemiologically important traits. 2. Here, we use an invertebrate predator, zooplankton host, yeast parasite system to demonstrate such trait-mediated indirect effects. We exposed ten genotypes of the prey/host Daphnia dentifera to infochemicals ('kairomones') produced by the invertebrate predator Chaoborus and to a yeast parasite. 3. We found that kairomone exposure induced larger and more susceptible D. dentifera. Clones that showed substantial increases in body length also yielded more spores upon death. However, exposure to kairomones did not alter reproduction from uninfected hosts. All of these results were captured with a dynamic energy budget model of parasitism. 4. Overall, our empirical and theoretical results show that predators can have strong indirect effects on host-parasite interactions that could produce positive correlations between predation intensity and disease burden.},

Thus, the degree of spatial overlap and rate of contact among deer is likely to impact both direct and indirect transmission of infectious diseases such chronic wasting disease (CWD) or bovine tuberculosis. We identified a strong relationship between degree of spatial overlap (volume of intersection) and genetic relatedness for female white-tailed deer in Wisconsin's area of highest CWD prevalence. We used volume of intersection as a surrogate for contact rates between deer and concluded that related deer are more likely to have contact, which may drive disease transmission dynamics. In addition, we found that age of deer influences overlap, with fawns exhibiting the highest degree of overlap with other deer. Our results further support the finding that female social groups have higher contact among related deer which can result in transmission of infectious diseases. We suggest that control of large social groups comprised of closely related deer may be an effective strategy in slowing the transmission of infectious pathogens, and CWD in particular.},

  abstract = {Many wildlife species ingest soil while feeding, but ingestion rates are known for only a few species. Knowing ingestion rates may be important for studies of environmental contaminants. Wildlife may ingest soil deliberately, or incidentally, when they ingest soil-laden forage or animals that contain soil. We fed white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) diets containing 0-15\% soil to relate the dietary soil content to the acid-insoluble ash content of scat collected from the mice. The relation was described by an equation that required estimates of the percent acid-insoluble ash content of the diet, digestibility of the diet, and mineral content of soil. We collected scat from 28 wildlife species by capturing animals, searching appropriate habitats for scat, or removing material from the intestines of animals collected for other purposes. We measured the acid-insoluble ash content of the scat and estimated the soil content of the diets by using the soil-ingestion equation. Soil ingestion estimates should be considered only approximate because they depend on estimated rather than measured digestibility values and because animals collected from local populations at one time of the year may not represent the species as a whole. Sandpipers (Calidris spp.), which probe or peck for invertebrates in mud or shallow water, consumed sediments at a rate of 7-30\% of their diets. Ninebanded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus, soil = 17\% of diet), American woodcock (Scolopax minor, 10\%), and raccoon (Procyon lotor, 9\%) had high rates of soil ingestion, presumably because they ate soil organisms. Bison (Bison bison, 7\%), black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus, 8\%), and Canada geese (Branta canadensis, 8\%) consumed soil at the highest rates among the herbivores studied, and various browsers studied consumed little soil. Box turtle (Terrapene carolina, 4\%), opossum (Didelphis virginiana, 5\%), red fox (Vulpes vulpes, 3\%), and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo, 9\%) consumed soil at intermediate rates. Ingested soil may be the principal means of exposure to some environmental contaminants or the principal source of certain minerals. Soil-ingestion estimates may be required for risk assessments of wildlife inhabiting contaminated sites and for computing budgets of those nutrients associated mainly with soil.},

In transgenic mice, expression of prion protein (PrP) from another species often confers susceptibility to prion disease from that donor species. For example, expression of deer or elk PrP in transgenic mice has induced susceptibility to chronic wasting disease (CWD), the prion disease of cervids. In the current experiments, transgenic mice expressing two naturally occurring allelic variants of deer PrP with either glycine (G) or serine (S) at residue 96 were found to differ in susceptibility to CWD infection. G96 mice were highly susceptible to infection, and disease appeared starting as early as 160 days postinfection. In contrast, S96 mice showed no evidence of disease or generation of disease-associated protease-resistant PrP (PrPres) over a 600-day period. At the time of clinical disease, G96 mice showed typical vacuolar pathology and deposition of PrPres in many brain regions, and in some individuals, extensive neuronal loss and apoptosis were noted in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Extraneural accumulation of PrPres was also noted in spleen and intestinal tissue of clinically ill G96 mice. These results demonstrate the importance of deer PrP polymorphisms in susceptibility to CWD infection. Furthermore, this deer PrP transgenic model is the first to demonstrate extraneural accumulation of PrPres in spleen and intestinal tissue and thus may prove useful in studies of CWD pathogenesis and transmission by oral or other natural routes of infection.},

An important factor controlling interspecies TSE susceptibility is prion protein (PrP) homology between the source and recipient species/genotypes. Furthermore, the efficiency with which the protease-resistant PrP (PrP-res) of one species induces the in vitro conversion of the normal PrP (PrP-sen) of another species to the protease-resistant state correlates with the cross-species transmissibility of TSE agents. Here we show that the CWD-associated PrP-res (PrPCWD) of cervids readily induces the conversion of recombinant cervid PrP-sen molecules to the protease-resistant state in accordance with the known transmissibility of CWD between cervids. In contrast, PrPCWD-induced conversions of human and bovine PrP-sen were much less efficient, and conversion of ovine PrP-sen was intermediate.

  abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is increasingly prevalent in multiple wild mule (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) herds in North America. CWD was first found in Canadian wild mule deer in Saskatchewan in 2000 and has since spread into the neighboring province of Alberta. The infectious agent for CWD is a misfolded prion protein encoded by the PRNP gene. Previous studies revealed association between PRNP genotype and susceptibility to CWD in both mule and white-tailed deer in other regions. To investigate this link in Canadian populations, PRNP gene sequence was examined in 166 CWD\textendash{} and 83 CWD+ mule deer, and 197 CWD\textendash{} and 30 CWD+ white-tailed deer from Saskatchewan and Alberta. Two variable sites were found in mule deer, and 15 in white-tailed deer. In both species PRNP genotype was associated with CWD status. Mule deer possessing at least one copy of the common allele at codon 20 were less likely to test positive for CWD than expected, given the frequency of this allele in the population. A variant at codon 96 in white-tailed deer was also linked with reduced incidence of CWD. A greater knowledge of the genetic sources of heterogeneity in CWD susceptibility may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the CWD epidemic in western Canada.},

  abstract = {The association between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt\textendash{}Jakob disease (vCJD) has demonstrated that cattle transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) can pose a risk to human health and raises the possibility that other ruminant TSEs may be transmissible to humans. In recent years, several novel TSEs in sheep, cattle and deer have been described and the risk posed to humans by these agents is currently unknown. In this study, we inoculated two forms of atypical BSE (BASE and H-type BSE), a chronic wasting disease (CWD) isolate and seven isolates of atypical scrapie into gene-targeted transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the human prion protein (PrP). Upon challenge with these ruminant TSEs, gene-targeted Tg mice expressing human PrP did not show any signs of disease pathology. These data strongly suggest the presence of a substantial transmission barrier between these recently identified ruminant TSEs and humans.},

  abstract = {Variation in PrP prion gene sequence appears to modulate susceptibility to chronic wasting disease (CWD), a naturally occurring prion disease affecting four North American species of the family Cervidae. Wapiti (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) PrP is polymorphic at codon 132 [methionine (M) or leucine (L)]. We genotyped 171 samples, collected between 2002 and 2005 from CWD-infected and uninfected wapiti from three free-ranging populations in Colorado, USA, to study influences of PrP polymorphisms on CWD susceptibility further. Overall genotype frequencies for 124 apparently uninfected animals were 65.3$\mkern1mu$\% MM132, 32.3$\mkern1mu$\% ML132 and 2.4$\mkern1mu$\% LL132; for 47 CWD-infected animals, these frequencies were 70.2$\mkern1mu$\% MM132, 27.7$\mkern1mu$\% ML132 and 2.1$\mkern1mu$\% LL132. Surprisingly, our data revealed that, among recent (approx. 2002\textendash{}2005) CWD cases detected in free-ranging Colorado wapiti, the three PrP codon 132 genotypes were represented in proportion to their abundance in sampled populations (P$\geq$0.24) and all three genotypes showed equivalent susceptibility to infection.},

  abstract = {For several decades scientists have speculated that the key to understanding age-related neurodegenerative disorders may be found in the unusual biology of the prion diseases. Recently, owing largely to the advent of new disease models, this hypothesis has gained experimental momentum. In a remarkable variety of diseases, specific proteins have been found to misfold and aggregate into seeds that structurally corrupt like proteins, causing them to aggregate and form pathogenic assemblies ranging from small oligomers to large masses of amyloid. Proteinaceous seeds can therefore serve as self-propagating agents for the instigation and progression of disease. Alzheimer's disease and other cerebral proteopathies seem to arise from the de novo misfolding and sustained corruption of endogenous proteins, whereas prion diseases can also be infectious in origin. However, the outcome in all cases is the functional compromise of the nervous system, because the aggregated proteins gain a toxic function and/or lose their normal function. As a unifying pathogenic principle, the prion paradigm suggests broadly relevant therapeutic directions for a large class of currently intractable diseases.},

  abstract = {Transmission of chronic wasting disease (CWD) between cervids is influenced by the primary structure of the host cellular prion protein (PrPC). In white-tailed deer, PRNP alleles encode the polymorphisms Q95 G96 (wild type [wt]), Q95 S96 (referred to as the S96 allele), and H95 G96 (referred to as the H95 allele), which differentially impact CWD progression. We hypothesize that the transmission of CWD prions between deer expressing different allotypes of PrPC modifies the contagious agent affecting disease spread. To evaluate the transmission properties of CWD prions derived experimentally from deer of four PRNP genotypes (wt/wt, S96/wt, H95/wt, or H95/S96), transgenic (tg) mice expressing the wt allele (tg33) or S96 allele (tg60) were challenged with these prion agents. Passage of deer CWD prions into tg33 mice resulted in 100\% attack rates, with the CWD H95/S96 prions having significantly longer incubation periods. The disease signs and neuropathological and protease-resistant prion protein (PrP-res) profiles in infected tg33 mice were similar between groups, indicating that a prion strain (Wisc-1) common to all CWD inocula was amplified. In contrast, tg60 mice developed prion disease only when inoculated with the H95/wt and H95/S96 CWD allotypes. Serial passage in tg60 mice resulted in adaptation of a novel CWD strain (H95+) with distinct biological properties. Transmission of first-passage tg60CWD-H95+ isolates into tg33 mice, however, elicited two prion disease presentations consistent with a mixture of strains associated with different PrP-res glycotypes. Our data indicate that H95-PRNP heterozygous deer accumulated two CWD strains whose emergence was dictated by the PrPC primary structure of the recipient host. These findings suggest that CWD transmission between cervids expressing distinct PrPC molecules results in the generation of novel CWD strains.
IMPORTANCE CWD prions are contagious among wild and captive cervids in North America and in South Korea. We present data linking the amino acid variant Q95H in white-tailed deer cellular prion protein (PrPC) to the emergence of a novel CWD strain (H95+). We show that, upon infection, deer expressing H95-PrPC molecules accumulated a mixture of CWD strains that selectively propagated depending on the PRNP genotype of the host in which they were passaged. Our study also demonstrates that mice expressing the deer S96-PRNP allele, previously shown to be resistant to various cervid prions, are susceptible to H95+ CWD prions. The potential for the generation of novel strains raises the possibility of an expanded host range for CWD.},
